The company dominates the high-growth artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, and this leadership has helped bring Nvidia triple-digit revenue growth in recent quarters, along with soaring share performance. Over the past five years, the stock has climbed a mind-blowing 2,600%, and it\\'s keeping up the momentum this year, heading for a gain of more than 180%.\\nThis top chip company has its share of competitors, from other chip designers like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel to its own customers -- due to their in-house chip projects. For example, customers, including Meta Platforms and Amazon, have built their own AI chips to complement their suite of Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs). Nvidia also faces up-and-coming players such as Cerebras Systems, a company that aims to soon launch an initial public offering (IPO).\\nAre You Missing The Morning Scoop?

Sign Up For Free »\\nThis list of competitors may sound worrisome for Nvidia and its investors, but Nvidia\\'s chief Jensen Huang recently said something that sounds like bad news for rivals.\\nFirst, let\\'s consider where Nvidia stands today. The company, which used to focus on serving the video games community with its GPUs in its earlier days, today has broadened the GPU into many other areas. And the place where it\\'s stood out is in AI. Customers are flocking to Nvidia for GPUs to power their data centers and projects for one simple reason: Its GPUs are the most powerful around.\\nThis year, the company launched the H200, a chip that delivers inference performance that\\'s twice as fast as its predecessor, and it quickly reached revenue in the double-digit billions. Nvidia recently said that the H200 represents its fastest production ramp up yet.\\nNow, Nvidia is heading into an even bigger launch -- the release of its Blackwell architecture and most powerful chip ever. The company aims to ramp up production in the current quarter and almost immediately generate several billion dollars in revenue from the platform.\\nAs mentioned, plenty of competition exists in the AI chip market, and these competitors\\' products have a lower price tag than those of Nvidia. In fact, Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing arm of Amazon, even developed an AI chip called Trainium with the cost-conscious customer in mind. One concern that some investors may have is this quest for savings could prompt customers to shift away from Nvidia and favor other players.\\nBut Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said something during the company\\'s recent earnings call that shows where Nvidia stands when it comes to its customers\\' costs -- and this could be seen as very bad news for rivals.\\nHuang says that even in the biggest data centers, power is limited, so performance per watt is critical. \"Because our perf per watt is so good compared to anything out there, we generate for our customers the greatest possible revenues,\" Huang says.\\nThis means that even if customers spend more on Nvidia\\'s GPUs up front, the high performance translates into stronger revenue. This could compensate for the initial investment and make the Nvidia product the best bargain for a customer over time. When potential customers consider their AI options, this point will come up -- and it may prompt some to go with Nvidia.\\nDoes this mean investors in Nvidia\\'s rivals should worry? Not necessarily. Nvidia isn\\'t putting other AI chip designers out of business. With an AI market forecast to reach $1 trillion by the end of the decade, there\\'s need for more than one provider of AI accelerators and related products -- so rivals can be successful without unseating Nvidia.\\nHowever, Nvidia investors should look at the comment from Huang as fantastic news, as it suggests Nvidia is conquering one of its biggest risks -- and is here to stay as the AI chip leader.\\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn\\'t one of them.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CFO Dive newsletter.\\nChipmaker Nvidia is seeking to shore up confidence in its ability to meet demand as supply concerns regarding AI chips rise.\\n'We are not near any point in time ... where we are seeing any type of a slowdown, but [what] we are seeing right now is demand continues to be fueled a lot due to the size of [AI] models, the complexity of inferencing and we are still getting ready for our next [chip] architecture, Blackwell,' Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said, speaking at a keynote address at the UBS Global Technology and AI Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona on Tuesday.\\nNvidia, the second most valuable publicly-traded U.S. company, has grown into a technology powerhouse fueling the rise of AI giants, including Microsoft, Google, Meta and Elon Musk's xAI.\\nDespite her optimistic tone, Kress acknowledged some supply pressure on the company's latest graphics processing unit, Blackwell. Considered an important building block for AI systems, graphics processing units are a type of chip designed to carry out rapid calculations.\\n'What we see in terms of our Blackwell [chip], which will be here this quarter, is also probably a supply constraint that is going to take us well into our next fiscal year for several quarters from now,' she said, while noting that this does not imply a slowdown.\\nNvidia, which has a market capitalization of $3.4 trillion, reported net income of $19.3 billion in its third quarter of fiscal year 2025, up 109% year over year. The company reported revenue of $35.1 billion for the quarter, up 94% year over year. Nvidia projects revenue of approximately $37.5 billion for the following quarter.\\nTimothy Arcuri, UBS analyst and conference moderator, said the company was shipping more Blackwell chips than it anticipated three months ago, to which Kress responded that the company is working to improve supply chain efficiency for its AI chips. 'What you're seeing with our Blackwell architecture, some of them we will completely build inside of our supply chain,' said Kress.\\nKress's remarks echo comments by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during the company's Q3 2025 earnings call last month, in which he acknowledged that demand exceeds supply for the Blackwell chips.\\nNvidia has 80% of the market share for AI chips, but still faces challenges from competitors, including Advanced Micro Devices, which expects to see AI chip sales of $5 billion this year, the Wall Street Journal reported in November. Large customers like Amazon and Microsoft have also been working on developing their own AI chips.\\nArcuri also asked Kress about the company's cash flow plans, noting that Nvidia has generated about $56 billion in the cash flow over the past four quarters.\\nNvidia 'isn't a fan' of excess cash, Kress said, noting the company is considering mergers and acquisitions and other new business opportunities.\\n'It leads to thinking about new types of business models that we may want to add and focus on in new areas of AI,' she said.\", 'rights': 'yahoo.com', 'rank': 41, 'topic': 'finance', 'country': 'US', 'language': 'en', 'authors': 'Suman Bhattacharyya', 'media': 'https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5dD10Er7sKrGga9JJhKhOw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cfo_dive_422/cfc5b111eda652a46d59c8798e32ed46', 'is_opinion': False, 'twitter_account': '@YahooFinance', '_score': 8.488269, '_id': 'd259ab842dd1c7061f448e977fa0a718'}, {'title': 'European AI infrastructure company Nebius nabs $700M from Nvidia, Accel, others', 'author': 'Paul Sawers', 'published_date': '2024-12-02 12:00:46', 'published_date_precision': 'full', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/european-ai-infrastructure-company-nebius-120046325.html', 'clean_url': 'yahoo.com', 'excerpt': 'Nebius, the publicly-traded European AI infrastructure company formerly known as Yandex N.V., has raised $700 million in financing to power its U.S. expansion.

The Netherlands-based business had been the holding company of Yandex, \"the Google of Russia,\" and after an extensive divestment process the company emerged as Nebius in July with plans to offer a \"full stack\" infrastructure for AI companies spanning data centers, GPUs, and related services.\\nIn addition to its core cloud infrastructure business, Nebius also runs a handful of additional businesses, including autonomous vehicle company Avride, based in Texas; a Netherlands-based generative AI and LLM company called Toloka; and edtech platform TripleTen, based in Wyoming.\\nCapital intensive\\nNebius is adopting a hybrid approach to growing its footprint, involving a mix of co-location facilities (shared data centers) which are quicker to set up, and its own \"greenfield\" sites built from scratch. But this is a heavily capital intensive effort, which is why it\\'s now raising additional funding via a private placement.\\nWhile Nebius competes with the usual cloud hyperscalers, it\\'s also up against well-financed private players such as CoreWeave which also counts Nvidia as an investor. Notably, CoreWeave is in the midst of expanding from the U.S. to Europe, while Nebius is moving in the opposite direction, recently announcing plans for a new GPU cluster at a co-location in Kansas City. Nebius also added a co-location site in Paris to its roster, while it\\'s planning to triple the capacity of its own flagship data center in Finland.\\nAfter the fire sale of its Russian assets earlier this year, Nebius had around $2.2 billion in the bank already -- however, it had ring-fenced a portion of that for a buy-back program in case any existing investors wanted to exit. After all, Nebius of 2024 is a totally different business to the Yandex N.V. entity that they had previously invested in. The offer amounted to a repurchase of up to 81 million Class A shares at a maximum of $10.5 per-share.\\nStory Continues\\nIn the six weeks that followed its reentry to the public markets, however, Nebius\\'s shares have hovered around the $21 mark (give or take), meaning that existing shareholders have had ample opportunity to sell at well over the buy-back agreement price. Thus, this offer is \"no longer warranted,\" according to Nebius, freeing up even more capital for the company as its expands its data center footprint.\\nSo the long and short of all this is that Nebius has in the region of $3 billion to build with, a figure that is still relatively low in terms of the capital required to build infrastructure at scale. Which is why Volozh says they are already looking ahead to raising more capital -- be that equity, or debt.\\n\"Of course, we will have some revenues that will help, but we will need more capital to build quicker,\" Volozh told TechCrunch. \"It\\'s very capital intensive. Technology and capital are two components of this business -- I don\\'t worry about the technology (side), and the capital, I think, we will be able to raise.\"\\nIt\\'s also worth noting that this renewed financial position means that Nebius has now upped its guidance, stating that it expects to reach an annualized run rate (ARR) of $750 million to $1 billion by the end of 2025. The company had recently pegged that guidance at $500 million to $1 billion, meaning that it\\'s now more confident of hitting the upper region of the original target.\\nAs part of its investment, Accel partner Matt Weigand will also be joining Nebius\\'s board of directors, though initially he will only have observer status until he\\'s formally elected at the company\\'s AGM in 2025.', 'rights': 'yahoo.com', 'rank': 41, 'topic': 'finance', 'country': 'US', 'language': 'en', 'authors': 'Paul Sawers,Min Read', 'media': 'https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/V83ZBdaUuahe.QQDPCz40g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/techcrunch_350/1758a5b9cbfe0578ebdabccfbaddb243', 'is_opinion': False, 'twitter_account': '@YahooFinance', '_score': 7.8315935, '_id': 'b7bda87a0d89990fcc94d51c14d95695'}, {'title': \"Andrew Left's Citron Research Says Nvidia-Backed Nebius Is The Next 'AI Wall Street Darling'\", 'author': 'Kaustubh Bagalkote', 'published_date': '2024-12-05 12:00:15', 'published_date_precision': 'full', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/andrew-lefts-citron-research-says-120015752.html', 'clean_url': 'yahoo.com', 'excerpt': \"Shares of Nebius Group NV (NASDAQ:NBIS) jumped 13.90% on Tuesday after Citron Research highlighted the company's potential to become the next artificial intelligence sensation on Wall Street, citing its deep ties with NVIDIA Corp.

The next members of the group will likely benefit from growing spending and reliance on AI in business and everyday life. However, one company, in particular, stands to benefit greatly from its massive investments in AI, and that could lead its stock to double in value over the next few years, leading it to a $3 trillion market cap.\\nI see Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) joining the $3 trillion club by 2028. Here\\'s how AI will help it get there.\\nMeta\\'s business has long relied on artificial intelligence, aka \"the algorithm.\" The algorithm is responsible for determining what content to put in front of a user and when to do it, whether that\\'s a photo from a friend, a video from a professional content producer, or an ad from a small business. In fact, Meta used multiple machine learning systems to determine the best content recommendations for each type of content across its various apps and surfaces.\\nHowever, the success of large language models led it to change course. It\\'s now developing a generalized content recommendation system across all surfaces inspired by the power of large-scale large language models. And it works better than its old algorithms. Another upside of this development is a more efficient software engineering team, which can work on a unified model instead of a bunch of individual recommendation engines.\\nWith generative AI, Meta brings to the table the ability to help marketers craft hundreds of different iterations of their ads. It has the scale to test each of those ads across its platform and optimize the targeting and creative to deliver the best possible results. CEO Mark Zuckerberg sees a day when an advertiser will be able to simply tell Meta its business objective and budget, and it\\'ll take care of the rest. That would drive significant sales growth as it would open the doors for more marketers with smaller creative teams to advertise more on Facebook and Instagram.\\nMeta also introduced the ability for businesses to create their own AI chat agents in WhatsApp and Messenger last year. These represent an opportunity to finally monetize its messaging apps by giving businesses a way to interact with potential customers at scale.\\nFinally, generative AI has the potential to lead to more user-generated content. In fact, Meta introduced a new feature in Meta AI, its AI chatbot built into its apps, which lets users take AI-generated images and share them to their feed or stories, or post them as their Facebook profile picture. It\\'s not hiding the fact that these are AI-generated, either, encouraging users who see the images to make their own images based on the ones they like.\\nInvestors can draw a clear picture of how artificial intelligence can increase engagement across Meta\\'s apps, improve its monetization, and ultimately lead to more efficient engineers. All of that leads to tangible financial outcomes like greater revenue and improved profit margins. That\\'s a lot more than many big companies riding the AI wave can say.\\nMeta has a market cap of just under $1.5 trillion as of this writing. To reach $3 trillion by 2028, the stock will have to produce compound annual returns of about 20%. That seems within reach for the tech stock, especially if AI helps fuel faster earnings growth.\\nAnalysts are currently modeling a 15% increase in revenue next year. If Meta can continue to grow revenue at that pace for the following three years, it\\'ll be on a strong path toward a $3 trillion valuation.\\nIn the near term, Meta\\'s massive capital expenditures to support its AI development will weigh on its operating margin as more and more of its spending today shows up as depreciation expenses down the line. Over time, however, the impact of that spending will dissipate as Meta continues to grow. What\\'s more, since depreciation is a non-cash expense, it means free cash flow will remain strong, giving management the opportunity to buy back shares. Ultimately, that should lead to strong earnings-per-share growth and justify a high earnings multiple.\\nMeta shares currently trade for just 22.5 times analysts\\' 2025 earnings estimate. By comparison, Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia trade for 31.6, 32.5, and 32.6 times forward earnings estimates. If Meta\\'s earnings multiple expands slightly toward the mid-20s as it shows strong financial results and continues to buy back shares, it should produce returns strong enough to push it past the $3 trillion mark.\\nOf course, there\\'s no way to know for certain that Meta can reach that milestone. However, based on everything we know today, the company is poised to grow thanks to its advancements in AI, and the market is offering a great price on the stock.\\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Companies have spent heavily to compete in the new world. Investors have ponied up to be a part of it, seemingly buying any stock that has an AI narrative and a large potential market -- even if the size of the market and actual uses are still somewhat vague.\\nOn the other hand, bank stocks have largely been ignored. Many view banking as a commoditized sector and banks have struggled with a range of issues including an inverted yield curve, a tougher regulatory landscape, a slowdown in mergers and acquisitions, several bank failures in 2023 that left a bad reputational overhang, and higher proposed capital rules. It\\'s easy to see why investors weren\\'t interested. Even after a big run in recent months, bank stocks have still greatly underperformed AI stocks and the broader market during this bull market.\\nIn the third quarter, several billionaires got wary of AI valuations and began to like the setup for banks. The Federal Reserve had started lowering interest rates, which began to normalize the inverted yield curve. Banks prefer a steepening yield curve because they generally borrow money short and lend it out long. President-Elect Donald Trump\\'s victory only stoked the flames, as investors saw an improving regulatory environment for banks, more mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and IPO activity, and continued economic growth.\\nHere are some sales of AI stocks and bank purchases that billionaire hedge fund managers made in Q3, which ended on Sept. 30.

Over the last two years, the company has become the undisputed leader among chip stocks, and with that, is swiftly emerging at the forefront of the pack among artificial intelligence (AI) companies more broadly.\\nIn my eyes, though, investors have been so eager to get in on the action with Nvidia that they've essentially forgotten about other opportunities in the chip realm. With 2024 coming to a close, I'd encourage investors to take a look around and consider what under-the-radar opportunities could be looming.\\nI'm going to make the case for why an investment in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) looks especially enticing right now. Could AMD be next year's Nvidia? I think so.\\nOn the surface, it would appear obvious that Nvidia is miles ahead of AMD in the AI marathon. Over the last 12 months, Nvidia has generated a mammoth $113 billion in revenue -- almost fivefold compared to that of AMD.\\nHowever, taking a look at where this revenue stems from may change how you think about AMD's trajectory in comparison to its larger cohort.\\nIn the table, I've broken down the annual revenue growth rates for each of AMD's and Nvidia's respective data center businesses:\\nData Source: Investor relations.\\nOver the last year, Nvidia's data center businesses has decelerated significantly. At the same time, AMD's data center business has evolved from essentially nothing to reaching more or less the same rate of growth compared to Nvidia.\\nDon't get me wrong -- I'm not going to posit the notion that Nvidia is in trouble. It's hard to make a bear case on a company that's posting growth in excess of 100% every quarter.\\nBut my broader point is that even though Nvidia is larger than AMD, that doesn't necessarily make it a better investment opportunity. I'm going to detail how AMD has built such a formidable competing data center business and explore why 2025 could be a milestone year for the company.\\nImage Source: Getty Images.\\nMuch of the reason why Nvidia experienced such enormous growth in its data center business stems from the fact that the company had virtually no competition in the graphics processing unit (GPU) landscape until recently. With the successful launch of AMD's MI300 accelerator, Nvidia's first-mover advantage is finally facing some headwinds.\\nNow, you may counter my point by arguing that Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture is going to help dissipate any chance of AMD dethroning the chip king. Well, consider the fact that many of Nvidia's own customers, including Microsoft and Meta Platforms, are also using AMD's MI300 GPUs.\\nOn top of that, remember that these big tech giants, in addition to Alphabet and Amazon (both of which are also Nvidia customers), are also investing heavily into the development of their own in-house chips in an effort to migrate away from an overreliance on Nvidia.\\nLastly, keep in mind that AMD is also developing a successor GPU to the MI300 called the MI325X -- slated to launch in 2025. Moreover, the company's MI400 architecture is targeting a launch date sometime in 2026.\\nMy point? I don't see Nvidia's Blackwell launch as much of a threat to AMD at all. AMD is innovating at an unprecedented pace, and considering investment in AI infrastructure is expected to rise for the next several years, I see the launch of the MI325X and MI400 as catalysts that can help AMD acquire incremental market share away from Nvidia.\\nAt the time of this writing, AMD trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 29. By comparison, Nvidia's forward P/E ratio is currently 34.\\nWith the Blackwell launch imminent, I can't help but feel that expectations surrounding Nvidia will creep higher. If the company fails to meet investor expectations, there could very well be a panic-driven sell-off in the stock.\\nMeanwhile, given AMD's meaningfully discounted valuation compared to Nvidia, I think investors are overlooking its new lineup of GPUs over the next two years. The existing footprint from the MI300, combined with next year's launch of the MI325X to compete head-to-head with Blackwell, should help AMD continue making headway against Nvidia -- in particular, from its own customer base, which is already demonstrating that it's looking for alternative GPU providers.\\nI think now is a lucrative time to buy AMD stock and prepare to hold on tight.\\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn't one of them.

Nvidia's revenues are on track to more than double this fiscal year led by surging demand for its GPUs which have become the de facto chips for AI applications. In contrast, Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) has had a tough year. The stock remains down by about 50% year-to-date and has a market cap of a mere $100 billion. Intel's revenues are expected to contract this year. But here's the twist: This might be the right time to rethink the AI bellwether. Why is that?\\nThe markets are often myopic and tend to extrapolate short-term trends for the long run. In Nvidia's case, they believe that demand for AI accelerators will hold up and Nvidia's margins and growth rates will remain strong. On the other hand, Intel's market share losses in the CPU space and its foundry business struggles have made investors pessimistic about its future. However, almost everything in life is cyclical and this couldn't be more true with the semiconductor markets. Reducing positions in Nvidia and considering Intel stock could be a wise move at this juncture. Here's why.\\nNvidia's AI Boom Might Be Front-Loaded\\nCompanies have devoted immense resources to building AI models over the last two years or so. Now training these massive models is more of a one-time affair that requires considerable computing power and Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of this, as its GPUs are regarded as the fastest and most efficient for these tasks. This is evident from Nvidia's recent revenue growth. Sales are on track to expand from a mere $27 billion in FY'23 to almost $130 billion in FY'25. However, the AI landscape may be evolving. As models grow larger in terms of several parameters, incremental performance gains are expected to diminish. Separately, the availability of high-quality data for training models is likely to become a bottleneck. With much of the Internet's high-quality data already run through by large language models, there could be a shift from large-scale, general-purpose AI models to smaller, specialized models – reducing demand for Nvidia's high-powered GPUs. The explosive demand Nvidia has witnessed over the last few years may very well have been front-loaded, with future growth very likely slowing.\\nNow, AI-related chip demand could shift from training to inference, which is the phase where trained models generate outputs. Inference is less computationally intensive and could open the door for alternative AI processors. To be sure, Nvidia will likely remain the leader by far in the inferencing space as well (it says that inferencing accounts for about 40% of its data center chip demand) but there's certainly an opening from rivals such as AMD and potentially even Intel to gain a bit of market share.\\nDuring the initial wave of generative AI, enterprises and big tech companies scrambled to invest in GPUs due to the 'fear of missing out,' without worrying about costs and returns on investments. This led to a surge in pricing power for Nvidia, with its net margins coming in at over 50% in recent quarters. However, companies and their investors will eventually look for returns on their investments meaning that they could become more judicious about AI costs going forward and this is likely to hurt margins. Moreover, besides rivals such as AMD and Intel, Nvidia's biggest customers such as Google and Amazon are doubling down on building their own AI chips. On Tuesday, Amazon announced plans to build an AI ultracluster, essentially a massive AI supercomputer that will be built using its proprietary Trainium chipsets. This could also pose a risk to Nvidia's business.\\nIntel's Foundry Business In Ripe For Turnaround\\nWhile the narrative around Nvidia has been the AI boom, the pessimism around Intel has been due to its foundry business. The business has posted sizable losses ($7 billion operating loss in 2023) and has also faced a tech handicap versus industry leader TSMC. However, the division is poised for a potential comeback with its newest 18A process node. This technology, featuring RibbonFET transistors and PowerVia backside power delivery, promises significant improvements in terms of performance and efficiency. Intel has already secured contracts with major players like Amazon, Microsoft, and the U.S. Department of Defense for custom chip designs using the 18A process. Intel has achieved some key technical milestones with this process and the company expects external customers to move their first 18A designs into production in 2025. If Intel successfully executes this transition, it could shift the narrative around its foundry business. See why 2025 Could Be Intel Stock's Comeback Year for an in depth look at how Intel stock could be re-rated higher.\\nMoreover, with Donald Trump set to return to the White House in 2025, Intel's extensive U.S. manufacturing footprint is also likely to emerge as a much more valuable asset. Trump's focus on boosting domestic manufacturing and reducing reliance on foreign supply chains could translate into favorable policies for Intel. Potential tariffs on foreign-made chips or incentives for domestic production could give Intel a competitive edge, particularly in its foundry division. Moreover, Intel's status as the only U.S.-based semiconductor company that designs and manufactures leading-edge chips positions it well to win more Federal government contracts.\\nIntel May Offer A Better Risk-Adjusted Return\\nIntel stock trades at a reasonable valuation at just 23x consensus 2025 earnings. The 2025 earnings estimate is in fact depressed versus historical levels, at just about $1 per share on account of Intel's current struggles. For perspective, Intel has reported earnings of close to $2 per share in 2022 and earnings of over $5 per share over 2021 and 2020. This means that if Intel sees earnings recover to historical levels in the coming years, the stock could similarly follow suit. The company is expected to return to revenue growth in 2024, with consensus estimates pointing to a 6% revenue increase and there are multiple tailwinds in both the chip and foundry business. Intel's improving CPU lineup, driven by the Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, positions it well for a recovery in the PC and server markets. Intel could also see incremental upside in the AI processor space with its Gaudi 2 and upcoming Gaudi 3 AI accelerators.\\nNvidia, on the other hand, trades at a lofty 48x projected FY'25 earnings. While Nvidia has seen impressive growth recently, it remains to be seen if the good times will last. And at the current valuation, we see little room for error. The risks we highlighted above could put Nvidia's future growth and margins at risk, weighing on the company's earnings. As the AI market shows signs of evolving, investors could see better risk-adjusted returns by moving from Nvidia to more undervalued semiconductor players like Intel. Considering the above factors, Intel may have only one way to go and that's probably up. For Nvidia, on the other hand, things could get a bit more tricky.\\n[1] Returns as of 12/4/2024\\n[2] Cumulative total returns since the end of 2016\\nInvest with Trefis Market-Beating Portfolios\\nSee all Trefis Price Estimates\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\", 'rights': 'nasdaq.com', 'rank': 769, 'topic': 'finance', 'country': 'US', 'language': 'en', 'authors': 'Trefis,Trefis Team', 'media': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg', 'is_opinion': False, 'twitter_account': '@Nasdaq', '_score': 9.542137, '_id': '242deec500d22f1b89b1f1e63ee755e4'}, {'title': 'Nvidia Stock Shocking Updates Investors Need to Know', 'author': 'The Motley Fool', 'published_date': '2024-12-03 16:06:00', 'published_date_precision': 'full', 'link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock-shocking-updates-investors-need-know', 'clean_url': 'nasdaq.com', 'excerpt': \"In today's video, I discuss recent updates impacting Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).

Why is this so important? For a couple of reasons. First, Blackwell includes Nvidia\\'s very latest innovations, demonstrating the company\\'s technological strengths, and therefore potentially ensuring its leadership in the artificial intelligence (AI) market. And second, this platform could be transformative for customers\\' AI projects, and this should translate into more revenue growth for Nvidia.\\nAs the AI boom has progressed, this tech giant has proven itself to be central to this high-growth market\\'s development. Nvidia dominates the AI chip market and has launched an entire portfolio of related products and services to form a complete AI empire. The Blackwell release will become a key part of the Nvidia picture. Now, with the launch set to happen, here\\'s what to look for.\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nFirst, a brief glance at Nvidia\\'s story so far. The company\\'s graphics processing units (GPUs) today bring in revenue primarily from AI customers, but this wasn\\'t always the case. Just a few years ago, GPUs mainly served the video games market, and Nvidia\\'s revenue was a fraction of today\\'s levels. But the GPUs ability to process many tasks at once made it ideal for uses well beyond gaming -- and it showed great potential in the area of AI.\\nNVDA Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts\\nAs Nvidia broadened into these markets, including AI, earnings took off and so did share performance. Earnings in most recent quarters have climbed in the triple digits, and Nvidia stock is heading for a 2,300% gain over the past five years.\\nNow, with Blackwell on the way, Nvidia and investors could see gains ahead in both earnings and share price performance.\\nSo, let\\'s take a look at what we know so far about the Blackwell release and what to look for ahead. Nvidia already has started bringing this top new platform to customers. In the third quarter, the company sent out 13,000 sample GPUs to customers. And also in the quarter, companies including Microsoft and Oracle posted on social media, saying they\\'d started to receive Blackwell.\\n\"Microsoft Azure is the 1st cloud running Nvidia\\'s Blackwell system with GB200-powered AI servers,\" Microsoft Azure wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on Oct. 8.\\nAnd Nvidia said in the company\\'s Nov. 20 fiscal third-quarter 2025 earnings call:\\n\"Blackwell is now in the hands of all of our major partners, and they are working to bring up their data centers. We are integrating Blackwell systems into the diverse data center configurations of our customers.\"\\nDemand for Blackwell has surpassed supply so it may take some time for Nvidia to serve every customer -- and reach its maximum revenue potential. But there\\'s reason to be optimistic about significant growth even in the early stages of product release. This is because Nvidia says it\\'s \"racing to scale supply\" -- and has predicted that Blackwell revenue in this current fourth quarter may beat its initial forecast of several billion dollars.\\nWhat we should look for next are trends at Nvidia\\'s customers: Have they succeeded in their scaling up of Blackwell? Are they offering Blackwell-powered products and services to their customers?\\nRight now, according to Nvidia, customers are preparing to offer Blackwell at scale. So, it will be important to be on the lookout for announcements or social media posts from cloud service providers and other major Nvidia customers for any details.\\nNvidia has said it\\'s ramping Blackwell production now in the fourth quarter, making this a major moment for the company. And, of course, any comments from Nvidia about the pace of the launch or demand should offer us clues about what to expect in the coming months.\\nWe also should keep in mind that Blackwell represents an opportunity that will extend well beyond this initial rollout period.

The company dominates the high-growth artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, and this leadership has helped bring Nvidia triple-digit revenue growth in recent quarters, along with soaring share performance. Over the past five years, the stock has climbed a mind-blowing 2,600%, and it\\'s keeping up the momentum this year, heading for a gain of more than 180%.\\nThis top chip company has its share of competitors, from other chip designers like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel to its own customers -- due to their in-house chip projects. For example, customers, including Meta Platforms and Amazon, have built their own AI chips to complement their suite of Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs). Nvidia also faces up-and-coming players such as Cerebras Systems, a company that aims to soon launch an initial public offering (IPO).\\nThis list of competitors may sound worrisome for Nvidia and its investors, but Nvidia\\'s chief Jensen Huang recently said something that sounds like bad news for rivals.\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nFirst, let\\'s consider where Nvidia stands today. The company, which used to focus on serving the video games community with its GPUs in its earlier days, today has broadened the GPU into many other areas. And the place where it\\'s stood out is in AI. Customers are flocking to Nvidia for GPUs to power their data centers and projects for one simple reason: Its GPUs are the most powerful around.\\nThis year, the company launched the H200, a chip that delivers inference performance that\\'s twice as fast as its predecessor, and it quickly reached revenue in the double-digit billions. Nvidia recently said that the H200 represents its fastest production ramp up yet.\\nNow, Nvidia is heading into an even bigger launch -- the release of its Blackwell architecture and most powerful chip ever. The company aims to ramp up production in the current quarter and almost immediately generate several billion dollars in revenue from the platform.\\nAs mentioned, plenty of competition exists in the AI chip market, and these competitors\\' products have a lower price tag than those of Nvidia. In fact, Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing arm of Amazon, even developed an AI chip called Trainium with the cost-conscious customer in mind. One concern that some investors may have is this quest for savings could prompt customers to shift away from Nvidia and favor other players.\\nBut Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said something during the company\\'s recentearnings callthat shows where Nvidia stands when it comes to its customers\\' costs -- and this could be seen as very bad news for rivals.\\nHuang says that even in the biggest data centers, power is limited, so performance per watt is critical. \"Because our perf per watt is so good compared to anything out there, we generate for our customers the greatest possible revenues,\" Huang says.\\nThis means that even if customers spend more on Nvidia\\'s GPUs up front, the high performance translates into stronger revenue. This could compensate for the initial investment and make the Nvidia product the best bargain for a customer over time. When potential customers consider their AI options, this point will come up -- and it may prompt some to go with Nvidia.\\nDoes this mean investors in Nvidia\\'s rivals should worry? Not necessarily. Nvidia isn\\'t putting other AI chip designers out of business. With an AI market forecast to reach $1 trillion by the end of the decade, there\\'s need for more than one provider of AI accelerators and related products -- so rivals can be successful without unseating Nvidia.\\nHowever, Nvidia investors should look at the comment from Huang as fantastic news, as it suggests Nvidia is conquering one of its biggest risks -- and is here to stay as the AI chip leader.\\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn\\'t one of them.

This is thanks to the company's position in one of today's highest-growth market\", 'summary': 'Business has exploded for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) over the past few years, with revenue surging in the triple digits quarter after quarter, and reaching record levels well into the billions of dollars. This is thanks to the company\\'s position in one of today\\'s highest-growth markets: artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia dominates the AI chip market, with 80% share, and also has built an AI empire, selling a wide variety of related products and services to customers.\\nAnd that\\'s helped the stock to skyrocket, gaining 2,400% over the past five years and heading for an annual increase of about 180%. Now, against this backdrop, Nvidia has reached a transition point. Its pace of revenue growth slowed in the recent quarter, and the company is beginning to launch a key product. Investors are carefully watching and wondering if Nvidia, following this big moment, will keep up its momentum or if it\\'s settling into a phase of slower growth. Want to know what\\'s next for this AI giant? A look at one key number could offer us some clues.\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nFirst, let\\'s check out Nvidia\\'s path so far, including the recent slowdown. Nvidia\\'s graphics processing units (GPUs) have emerged as the fastest on the market, making them a key part of AI programs, and this has resulted in major demand from the world\\'s biggest tech companies.\\nPlayers like Meta Platforms, eager to supercharge AI programs, and Amazon, aiming to offer the world\\'s best AI tools to customers through its Amazon Web Services business, have flocked to Nvidia for its products in recent years. And this has translated into soaring demand for the company\\'s newest offering, the Blackwell architecture and chip. Nvidia called demand \"staggering\" in its recentearnings calland has said it surpasses supply.\\nIn spite of all of this, Nvidia\\'s revenue growth slowed in the recent quarter, shifting to double-digit growth from the triple-digit growth we\\'ve seen in previous quarters. Before worrying though, it\\'s important to take a look at the actual revenue figures, and here, we can see that comparison quarters have become very difficult. Considering demand for Nvidia\\'s products at the earlier stages of the AI boom, it was \"easy\" for the company to increase revenue in the triple digits in the second quarter of the 2024 fiscal year, for example, from the level of about $6 billion in the year-earlier period. Today, it\\'s more difficult to do this with quarterly revenue topping $35 billion. So, I wouldn\\'t look at this revenue trend as a sign of a slowdown at Nvidia.\\nNow, let\\'s consider what\\'s next for Nvidia, using a key number to help us. And this is gross margin. Along with Nvidia\\'s surging revenue, the company has been able to maintain margins of more than 70% -- so it\\'s highly profitable on its sales.\\nJust ahead, we could expect profitability to dip slightly in the coming months as Nvidia completes the production ramp of Blackwell. Nvidia\\'s gross margin has been in the mid-70% range in recent times but will fall to the low-70% range, the company predicts. Even this level is pretty amazing, especially considering the complexity of the Blackwell rollout.\\nBlackwell is an architecture that can be tailored to the needs of each customer, with seven different chips, various networking options, and other customizable details. Organizing the production ramp of such a system and serving the needs of major tech company customers is Nvidia\\'s priority right now -- and this along with the costs of putting these logistics into place will weigh on the profitability of each sale.\\nSo, we shouldn\\'t expect maximum profitability right out of the gate. But here\\'s the good news. Nvidia already is predicting gross margin will return to the mid-70% range, possibly in the second half of next year. That means we can expect Nvidia to maintain its high level of profitability. At the same time, demand suggests revenue, too, should continue to climb.\\nSo, yes, we should expect a modest dip in profitability in the coming months as Nvidia ramps production of Blackwell, but this looks like a temporary situation. Over the long term, Nvidia is on track to keep up the momentum we\\'ve seen in recent quarters as customers pour investment into their AI platforms. Today\\'s $200 billion AI market is forecast to reach $1 trillion by the end of the decade, another positive sign for this AI leader.\\nAll of this means that investors shouldn\\'t focus too much on the short term and instead should consider Nvidia\\'s long-term prospects. And Nvidia\\'s profitability track record and forecasts for gross margin to come are reasons to be optimistic.\\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Considering that the majority of servers built for AI have Nvidia GPUs in them, it knows plenty about what's happening in that part of the computing space.\\nDuring Nvidia's Q3 conference call, it highlighted one company that it's working with to bring AI to more customers: Accenture (NYSE: ACN), the largest tech consulting firm in the world.\\nNvidia CFO Colette Kress said during its conference call that Accenture created a new unit with 30,000 employees trained on Nvidia's AI technology. This makes it one of the most well-equipped companies to provide clients with the AI expertise they may lack in-house. While tech giants like Alphabet or Microsoft have huge teams devoted to this technology, companies in the banking, industrial, or oil sectors, for example, are unlikely to have those sorts of internal resources. As a result, they need to work with consulting firms like Accenture.\\nAccenture CEO Julie Sweet had this to say about generative AI:\\nIn every industry, there is a challenge or opportunity that GenAI can now uniquely solve. Our deep understanding of both the industry and the technology positions us to be the best at creating real value from GenAI with our clients.\\nThat perfectly sums up the AI-related investment thesis for Accenture, as it is set to benefit from generative AI going mainstream in the coming years. Still, it is a huge consulting firm with many areas of specialization and expertise. It isn't an AI pure-play.\\nBut does the rest of the business plus an AI boost equal a winning investment?\\nIn its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, which ended Aug. 31, Accenture saw new bookings of $20.1 billion, of which generative AI made up $1 billion. So while generative AI has clearly given the business a boost, it only accounted for 5% of total bookings, making it a relatively minor part of the larger investment picture.\\nFiscal 2024 wasn't the greatest year for Accenture, as clients were conservative with their spending. Revenue rose just 3% in Q4 and only 1% for the year. The outlook for fiscal 2025 is slightly better -- management expects revenue to grow by 3% to 6% in local currencies. (As a global business headquartered in Ireland, it's exposed to changes in currency exchange rates.) Still, considering that many AI companies are boosting their revenue at much faster rates than that, is Accenture worth investing in?\\nFrom a forward price-to-earnings standpoint, Accenture's stock is quite expensive.\\nACN PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.\\nShares are trading at around 28 times forward earnings, a similar valuation to Meta Platforms and Taiwan Semiconductor, both of which are growing much faster than it is. So why would Accenture make a better stock pick?\\nOne advantage investors get from Accenture is its generous shareholder capital return program. It increased its dividend by 15% in Q4, and at the current share price, it has a yield of about 1.6%. It also repurchases a lot of stock -- $4.5 billion worth last year alone. Reducing the outstanding share count boosts its earnings per share, which are expected to increase between 5% and 8% in fiscal 2025.\\nStill, even with the dividend and stock buyback program, Accenture's stock is a bit too expensive for my taste, especially when there are other AI companies that are growing much faster and trade at similar or cheaper valuations. As a result, I'll take a pass on it for now.\\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The chipmaker is only a few weeks away from delivering its fourth gain of over 100% in the last five years.\\nIn 2023, Nvidia reigned as the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 Index. Is a repeat performance coming? Probably not. Meet the only three S&P 500 stocks that are beating Nvidia this year.\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics software company Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) is one of the newest members of the S&P 500, joining the prestigious index in September 2024. This newbie is now the best-performing stock in the S&P with a year-to-date gain of over 300%. That\\'s well above Nvidia\\'s gain of around 180%.\\nSure, Palantir\\'s inclusion in the S&P 500 boosted its share price. However, the stock was already a huge winner thanks largely to its impressive growth. This momentum continued in the third quarter of 2024, with Palantir reporting its revenue jumped 30% year over year. CEO Alexander Karp said the strong performance was \"driven by unrelenting AI demand that won\\'t slow down.\"\\nPalantir stock has especially taken off after the U.S. presidential election in November. The company is widely viewed as a likely winner in President-elect Trump\\'s next administration.\\nVistra (NYSE: VST) provides electricity in 20 states. Some investors might view utility stocks as boring. However, Vistra has been downright exciting in 2024 with its share price quadrupling year to date, lagging only slightly behind Palantir.\\nOne key secret to Vistra\\'s recent success is the resurgence of the nuclear power industry. In 2023, roughly 7% of the company\\'s power generation capacity came from nuclear power plants. Earlier this year, though, Vistra completed its acquisition of Energy Harbor, adding around 4,000 megawatts of nuclear generation capacity.\\nVistra has at least one thing in common with Nvidia: Both companies benefit from the soaring demand for AI. The data centers that run AI applications require tremendous amounts of electricity. Vistra finalized agreements in the third quarter of 2024 to provide power to Amazon in Texas and Microsoft in Illinois -- a sign of how important data centers have become to the company\\'s business.\\nTexas Pacific Land Corp. (NYSE: TPL) owns around 873,000 acres in Texas. Most of this land is in the Permian Basin, the highest-producing oil region in the U.S. TPL is enjoying a banner year in 2024, with its share price up over 190%.\\nThe company conducted a three-for-one stock split on March 18, 2024. However, this stock split wasn\\'t a major factor in TPL\\'s outstanding gains this year. The stock received an even bigger boost after the announcement that it would replace Integra Lifesciences Holdings in the S&P MidCap 400 in June. Only a few days ago, TPL was added to the S&P 500.\\nTexas Pacific Land isn\\'t an oil and gas producer, but the company makes money from royalties it receives from oil and gas producers. The \"drill, baby, drill\" approach of the incoming Trump administration could be positive for TPL.\\nWhich of these three stocks is most likely to beat Nvidia again in 2025? My pick is Vistra.\\nI like Palantir\\'s business prospects. However, like some Wall Street analysts, I\\'m concerned about its sky-high valuation. I also think Texas Pacific Land has solid prospects, but I don\\'t have a warm-and-fuzzy feeling that the landowner will be able to outperform Nvidia next year.\\nVistra, on the other hand, could continue to benefit from AI data center growth and increasing interest in nuclear power. The stock\\'s price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is a low 0.89, according to LSEG. I wouldn\\'t bet the farm that Vistra will deliver a bigger gain than Nvidia will in 2025, but I suspect it\\'s in the strongest position to do so among these three stocks.\\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn\\'t one of them.

Its share price has increased 845% during that period due to strong earnings growth driven by tremendous demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs).\\nNvidia is once again poised to generate market-beating returns for shareholders in 2025. The most obvious reason is its leadership in artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators, a market where spending is projected to grow at 29% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research. But there are less obvious factors at play, too.\\nRead on to learn more.\\nForrester Research analysts led by Mike Gualtieri recently wrote, \"Without Nvidia\\'s GPUs, modern AI wouldn\\'t be possible.\" There are two reasons for the company has become so dominant: (1) Nvidia GPUs are supported by an unmatched ecosystem of software development tools called CUDA, and (2) Nvidia GPUs consistently outperform rival chips at AI training and inference tasks.\\nBuilding on that second point, Nvidia is currently ramping production of its next-generation Blackwell GPU, which offers up to 4 times faster AI training and 30 times faster AI inferencing versus the previous Hopper GPU architecture. CFO Colette Kress recently told analysts that \"Blackwell demand is staggering.\" Indeed, the new chip is already sold out for 12 months.\\nAdditionally, CEO Jensen Huang has said the Blackwell GPU architecture may be the most successful product in company history, and perhaps the history of the entire computing industry. That sets Nvidia shares up for market-beating returns as Blackwell sales hit the top line next year.\\nNvidia\\'s gross margin peaked at 78.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended in April 2024. That figure has since contracted to 74.6%. Bears attribute that margin decline to an erosion in pricing power brought on by competition, overlooking the fact that Nvidia\\'s operating margin is 18 percentage points above that of the next closest Magnificent Seven company.\\nAdmittedly, Nvidia does face competition from other chipmakers and even some of its own customers. For instance, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet have developed custom AI accelerators. But those competitors lack a software development ecosystem that rivals CUDA, something Nvidia has been building nearly two decades. That ultimately makes competing chips much less useful to developers.\\nSo, Nvidia shareholders have little to fear from competition in the near term. Indeed, CFO Colette Kress says Blackwell gross margins should be in the mid-70% range after the production ramp. In other words, while gross margin may drop a little more in the next quarter or two, it should rebound thereafter. That pokes a hole in the theory that Nvidia is imminent danger of losing pricing power.\\nIndeed, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore recently commented, \"The market tends to underestimate the difficulty of competing with Nvidia.\" That should become increasingly clear next year, and the stock could soar as investors fully appreciate Nvidia\\'s dominance.\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has proposed lowering the federal corporate income tax rate to 15%. While a lower corporate tax rate has not always led to a boom in the broader stock market, it could move the needle for individuals companies by boosting profit margins. In turn, excess capital could be returned to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends.\\nImportantly, Nvidia repurchased about $26 billion worth of its stock during the 12-month period that ended in June 2024. Only three other companies in the S&P 500 allocated more to share buybacks during that period: Apple spent $96 billion, Alphabet spent $63 billion, and Meta Platforms spent $41 billion, according to S&P Global.\\nNvidia could lean further into stock buybacks if the corporate tax rate was lowered. That would accelerate earnings-per-share growth by reducing the outstanding share count. So, a reduction in corporate taxes could result in Nvidia\\'s earnings growing more quickly than Wall Street analysts anticipate, which could drive shares higher.\\nAdmittedly, while the Trump administration could get legislation through Congress in 2025, any changes would not take effect until the next year. That means Nvidia would not see any benefit in 2025 even in the best case scenario. But the stock market is forward-looking, so if investors believe the tax rate will decline, the impact could be priced into the stock next year.\\nNvidia\\'s market value has increased more than nine-fold since the beginning of 2023, but the company\\'s stock still trades at a surprisingly reasonable valuation, especially in comparison to other AI companies.\\nWall Street expects Nvidia\\'s adjusted earnings to grow 50% over the next year, and the stock currently trades at 52.7 times adjusted earnings. Those numbers give a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio slightly above 1. Listed below are PEG ratios (calculated in exactly the same manner) for other popular AI stocks:\\nIn general, PEG ratios below 1 are considered cheap, and values between 1 and 2 are seen as reasonable. In that context, Nvidia shares are remarkably inexpensive at their current share price of $138, which positions the stock for market-beating returns next year.\\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn\\'t one of them.

The company\\'s leading position in the data center market has driven triple-digit revenue growth over the last few years. Nvidia is now one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a $3.4 trillion market cap at present.\\nHowever, with $113 billion in trailing revenue, Nvidia has become a very large business, which will make it more difficult to maintain this level of growth. Nvidia\\'s top-line growth is already slowing from triple-digit rates, coming in at 94% year over year in the most recent quarter. The stock soared on accelerating growth, but slowing growth could weigh on shareholder returns over the next few years.\\nThe good news is there are plenty of other opportunities to profit off the AI arms race. If you\\'re looking for smaller AI companies that can potentially deliver monster returns, here are two to consider buying heading into 2025.\\nShares of this AI voice-solutions provider have given investors a wild ride over the last few years, but the stock is surging following another strong quarter of growth. As its latest results show, SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) is still a relatively small company going after a big opportunity.\\nThe company\\'s revenue grew 89% year over year in the third quarter, which was partly boosted by a recent acquisition and expanding market demand for its AI voice solutions. It continued to see double-digit growth from automotive, but it\\'s also having success diversifying into customer service and retail-banking solutions through its acquisition of Amelia.\\nWhile SoundHound\\'s business is still unprofitable -- it reported a loss of $22 million on just $25 million of revenue last quarter -- the stock is moving higher because the company is showing that there is, indeed, a large and growing market for its technology. SoundHound\\'s AI agents are helping reduce the number of calls coming into customer support centers.\\nMoreover, its Smart Ordering AI service for restaurants recently crossed the 100 million customer-interaction milestone. Major restaurant brands, like Chipotle Mexican Grill, Jersey Mike\\'s, and Applebee\\'s, are using SoundHound\\'s technology.\\nThe company is also positioning itself as a leader in generative AI voice assistance for drivers. A recent survey commissioned by tSoundHound with Big Village found that 76% of U.S. drivers would use an AI-powered voice assistant if it was available in the car. This could be a huge opportunity over the long term, since nearly half of drivers expressed frustration in finding and operating car features.\\nSoundHound\\'s voice assistance could prove to be a must-have for car manufacturers and already has a strong foothold in the market. A partnership with Stellantis, owner of the Jeep, Dodge, and Ram line of vehicles, has brought SoundHound\\'s generative AI assistance to several of the company\\'s European brands, including Alfa Romeo, Peugeot, and DS Automobiles.\\nAlthough the stock has jumped sharply in the last few months, I wouldn\\'t be afraid of starting a position here. SoundHound is growing at a brisk pace and has a market capitalization of just $3.4 billion. I would look at the stock\\'s recent advance as a bullish indicator of the future. While the shares will be volatile, an investment in SoundHound could be very rewarding over the next decade as the business expands into retail and banking.\\nThe insatiable demand for Nvidia\\'s chips can point you to other opportunities in the AI infrastructure market. Astera Labs (NASDAQ: ALAB) is a leading supplier of connectivity products for data centers.\\nThese products allow data to be transmitted between chips and are just as essential as the graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia for enabling AI training. With demand for its products surging, Astera Labs just completed its initial public offering (IPO) earlier this year and could be looking at years of strong growth.\\nAstera Labs\\' revenue grew 206% year over year in the third quarter, which shows the company emerging as a leader in this market. \"Our business has now entered a new growth phase with multiple product families ramping [up] across AI platforms based upon both third-party GPUs and internally developed AI accelerators,\" CEO Jitendra Mohan said.\\nThe stock looks very expensive. Astera Labs generated only $305 million in trailing revenue, which doesn\\'t appear to be enough to support its $16 billion market value. But investors are paying a high valuation, expecting the company to maintain a high level of growth for several more years -- and there are a few reasons why it can meet those expectations.\\nThe company is diversifying its product lineup, which is also expanding its addressable market opportunity. Importantly, management is investing in products that can drive higher profitability over the long term. For example, Astera\\'s new Scorpio Smart Fabric switches help data centers improve performance and command high average selling prices that could be beneficial to margins.\\nAstera Labs earns a high gross margin of nearly 78%, which means customers are willing to pay a premium for its products. The company\\'s adjusted net income was $40 million in Q3 on $113 million of revenue -- a stellar profit margin of 35%.\\nAI is a major long-term growth catalyst for chip suppliers and other infrastructure companies. There will be more data centers and AI servers built over the next 10 years. Adding shares of a fast-growing supplier like Astera Labs could help you profit off that opportunity.\\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

After another incredible quarter in which it doubled its earnings per share (EPS) year over year, the chipmaker\\'s stock sank in the days following its Q3 numbers release. The fact is, expectations could hardly be higher. It\\'s a good thing the company appears to be still firing on all cylinders.\\nThis isn\\'t the first time it\\'s been in this situation, and it\\'s likely not the last. Nvidia saw its stock retreat nearly 20% in the weeks following its last release, only to gain nearly 35% from that low. There is good reason to remain optimistic, as the next year is full of major catalysts for the company.\\nOn Tuesday, Dec. 3, Nvidia joined other leading Artificial Intelligence (AI) firms to discuss the future of the industry with the investment community. The annual UBS Global Technology and AI Conference presents a chance for Nvidia to show continued leadership and make the case for why it has so much further to go. The event marries the technical with the practical, shedding light on just how impactful AI can be in creating real-world value.\\nWhile one event is unlikely to move the needle, every chance the company -- and the industry, for that matter -- has a chance to make its case count. Here are three reasons why Nvidia is a buy as the event gets underway.\\nLook, this is hardly news, but it bears repeating: the AI market is huge, growing rapidly, and there\\'s ample reason to believe this will continue. PwC -- one of the \"big four\" accounting firms -- believes AI can add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Statista predicts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the total AI market of 28.3% through 2030.\\nIt\\'s not just the analysts and talking heads that think so; CEOs from around Silicon Valley reiterated their commitment to AI and, more to the point, to spending billions of dollars on AI infrastructure. In Meta\\'s last earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that despite record capital expenditures, his company \"should invest more\" because AI will \"accelerate [Meta\\'s] core business\" and \"should have strong ROI over the next few years.\\nThat is great news for Nvidia. The company\\'s chips supply the vast majority of the industry, and this market dominance is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. At this point, not even AMD can offer a chip that matches the performance of Nvidia\\'s flagship chips. While this lead will likely shrink as time passes, it\\'s doubtful Nvidia\\'s would be leapfrogged. Nvidia has enormous resources -- in capital and talent -- it can use to defend its pole position.\\nBlackwell, Nvidia\\'s newest line of Superchips, releases this month, and samples are already in the hands of many of its major clients. The chips are incredibly powerful, more than twice as powerful as its current Hopper chips, and demand for them is at a fever pitch. CEO Jensen Huang described the demand as \"staggering\" and reports have indicated the company has been sold out of them for a full year.\\nThis is a big moment for Nvidia, and Wall Street is keen to see the company deliver a successful launch. If there are hiccups expected, Nvidia\\'s executive team certainly didn\\'t share them in its Q3earnings call The team painted a rosy picture of the next year and Blackwell\\'s roll-out, expecting more Blackwells to ship than previously expected. I think there is a good chance that revenue from Blackwell will be even larger than Wall Street expects, but we will learn much more in the coming months.\\nThe term has been thrown around a lot recently, but a big focus of Nvidia\\'s call, apart from the launch of Blackwell, was the development and adoption of agentic AI -- essentially AI that can actually do, not just create. Jensen Huang likes to think of them as \"AI coworkers\" that can \"assist employees in performing their jobs faster and better.\"\\nI think that agentic AI if done well, is where the real value of AI lies. This is where true efficiencies can be made throughout organizations of all types. One of the ongoing questions in the market as a whole is whether AI can deliver value that justifies the enormous costs involved. If it can, this is where we will see it.\\nNvidia is ahead of this trend, offering \"an operating platform of agentic AI,\" as Huang puts it, insisting that industry leaders are already using it to build \"copilots\" -- an industry term for AI helpers and agents.\\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn\\'t one of them.

That\\'s what appears to be shaping up for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Shares of the GPU maker are up big with only a few weeks remaining in the year.\\nIt\\'s too late for investors who don\\'t own Nvidia to benefit from the stock\\'s past performance. But should you buy Nvidia stock hand over fist before the end of 2024? Here\\'s what history suggests.\\nThere\\'s often no reason to hurry to buy a stock. Whether you purchase shares immediately or a few months later doesn\\'t matter too much in many cases. However, it\\'s been a different story with Nvidia.\\nThe company conducted its initial public offering on Jan. 22, 1999. In the nearly 25 years since then, Nvidia has delivered a positive return in the first quarter 20 times. The stock\\'s average Q1 gain is an impressive 19%. If you waited until after the beginning of the year, you would have been poorer most of the time.\\nIn 14 of Nvidia\\'s 25 full first quarters since its IPO, the stock has delivered a double-digit percentage gain. The most impressive performance came last year when Nvidia\\'s share price skyrocketed 90%. But the first quarter of 2024 ranks as the stock\\'s second-best Q1 performance ever with a huge gain of 82.5%.\\nNVDA data by YCharts\\nGranted, Nvidia has turned in some dismal Q1 performances. In the first quarter of 2008, the stock plunged roughly 42%. However, over the last 10 years, Nvidia has experienced only one negative first quarter with its shares falling around 7% in Q1 of 2022.\\nOf course, most investors won\\'t buy Nvidia shares before the end of a given year and then sell them three months or so later. How has the stock performed over longer periods?\\nNvidia delivered a positive return in 17 of the 23 three-year periods since the company\\'s IPO (including the period between 2022 and 2024). The average return for these three-year periods was around 195%.\\nBut if you bought before the end of a given year and held onto the stock for five years, you\\'d really be sitting pretty. Nvidia\\'s share price has risen in 19 out of 21 five-year periods since its IPO. The average return for these five-year periods was a staggering 551%.\\nWhat\\'s the bottom line from a historical standpoint when it comes to buying Nvidia stock before the end of the year? It nearly always pays off handsomely.\\nNow for the bad news: There\\'s a good case to be made that history doesn\\'t matter much regarding investing in Nvidia. Why? The present is unlike the past.\\nMost of Nvidia\\'s stellar performances in previous years came before the generative AI explosion. Interest rates were also much lower during the period when Nvidia delivered its greatest gains. Rivals are scrambling to develop chips that compete with Nvidia\\'s GPUs. The stock\\'s future returns may be significantly lower in the future as the supply of AI chips catches up with demand, interest rates remain higher (relatively speaking), and competition intensifies.\\nHowever, there\\'s also an argument that Nvidia\\'s future could be even brighter than its past. CEO Jensen Huang believes that the company\\'s new Blackwell GPU architecture could become the most successful product in not only Nvidia\\'s history but in \"the history of the computer.\" Importantly, Nvidia is now on a yearly cycle of launching new chips, so even more powerful GPUs will be on the way after Blackwell.\\nAI is still only in its early innings. New advances, potentially including artificial general intelligence (AGI), could boost Nvidia\\'s growth like never before. Even if we eliminate AI altogether, the company could have a $1 trillion opportunity as organizations shift from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing.\\nIf you think Nvidia\\'s growth prospects will improve (and there\\'s good reason to do so), throw out the history books: Buying this stock hand over fist before the end of the year makes perfect sense.\\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\\'ll want to hear this.\\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \\'Double Down\\' stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you\\'re worried you\\'ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it\\'s too late.

At the time of this writing, its stock has soared 187% year to date, because the company is delivering incredible revenue growth as chip demand continues to outstrip supply.\\nBut Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes data center operators will spend $1 trillion upgrading their infrastructure to meet the needs of AI developers over the next four years, so this opportunity is big enough to support several GPU suppliers. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) recently launched a series of AI GPUs of its own, and the company has already won some of Nvidia's biggest customers.\\nHere's why AMD stock might be a great buy in the new year, even for investors who already own Nvidia.\\nNvidia had an estimated 98% share in the market for data center GPUs during 2023, because there was practically no competition for its flagship H100 chip. However, AMD launched its MI300X GPU in December, and it quickly attracted many of Nvidia's top customers like Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Oracle.\\nAccording to AMD, many of those data center operators are yielding better performance and a lower cost of ownership by using the MI300X versus the H100, which bodes well for AMD's attempt to capture market share. However, Nvidia isn't standing still -- its H200 is already in the market, which is twice as powerful as its H100, and it just started shipping its new Blackwell GPUs.\\nThe Blackwell-based GB200 NVL72 system can perform AI inference at 30 times the speed of the equivalent H100 system, so AMD has a big mountain to climb in order to catch up. The company just started shipping its MI325X to customers, which offers 20% better inference performance than the H200, which is a good start.\\nBut investors have already turned their attention to AMD's MI350 series, which should reach customers in the second half of 2025. It uses the company's new CDNA (Compute DNA) 4 architecture, which delivers a performance boost of 35 times compared to CDNA 3 chips like the MI300. In other words, it's going to be a formidable competitor for Nvidia's Blackwell chips, even though it's launching more than six months later.\\nAI developers typically pay for computing capacity by the minute, so faster chips can translate into substantial cost savings. Therefore, performance can determine which chip giant wins market share, and that's why Nvidia and AMD are fighting so hard to launch faster chips every six to 12 months.\\nData centers will always play a key role in training AI models and supporting AI inference, but the chips inside smartphones and computers are becoming powerful enough to run some AI workloads on-device. That creates a faster user experience because chatbot queries, for example, don't have to travel to the data center before a response can be formulated.\\nAMD dominates the market for AI chips used in personal computers (PCs). Its Ryzen AI 300 Series delivers industry-leading performance across the GPU, central processor (CPU), and the new neural processor (NPU), which allows the user to effortlessly run AI chatbot applications.\\nIn fact, the Ryzen AI 300 Series is three times more powerful when it comes to AI performance than AMD's previous generation of chips. They already power Microsoft's new Copilot+ PCs, and manufacturers like Lenovo and HP plan to triple the number of Ryzen AI devices they offer by the end of 2024. Next year, AMD expects there will be more than 100 computing platforms using those chips in commercial settings.\\nAMD generated a record $6.8 billion in total revenue during the third quarter of 2024 (ended Sept. 28), which was an 18% increase from the year-ago period. However, its AI-related segments delivered much faster growth.\\nThe company's data center revenue soared 122% to a record $3.5 billion, led by GPU sales. AMD CEO Lisa Su now says GPU revenue alone could hit $5 billion in 2024, which is more than 150% higher than her original forecast of $2 billion coming into the year.\\nAMD's client segment revenue jumped 29% to $1.9 billion. It's home to the Ryzen AI chips, and considering Su believes the AI PC cycle is still in its infancy, investors should look for strong growth in this segment throughout 2025.\\nThe reason AMD's total revenue growth wasn't higher than 18% is because the company's gaming segment saw a 69% decline in sales compared to the year-ago period. Demand is slowing for flagship consoles like Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation 5, and PC gamers are eagerly awaiting a new generation of AMD GPUs that will ship in 2025.\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nThe Wall Street Journal tracks 54 analysts covering AMD stock, and 37 have given it the highest-possible buy rating. Seven more are in the overweight (bullish) camp, and 10 recommend holding. No analysts recommend selling.\\nThey have an average price target of $185.77 for the next 12 to 18 months, implying an upside of 31% from where the stock trades as of this writing. However, the Street-high target of $250 suggests AMD stock could soar by 76%.\\nAccording to Yahoo!, Wall Street's consensus forecast for 2025 suggests AMD's earnings per share (EPS) could soar 54% to $5.14, which places its stock at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.6. The stock would have to soar 71% next year just to trade in line with its current P/E ratio of 47.3 (based on the company's trailing-12-month EPS of $3), so the Street-high target might actually be realistic.\\nAMD's forward P/E is also much cheaper than Nvidia's forward P/E ratio of 31.3. Nvidia deserves a premium valuation because it's growing its revenue and earnings faster than AMD right now, plus it still has a clear lead in the data center GPU space.\\nHowever, Nvidia has so much market share that it's likely to only shrink from here, whereas AMD is only just starting to break into the segment, so its best growth might still be ahead. Moreover, as the leader in the chip segment for AI PCs, AMD has a front-row seat to what could be the next big growth catalyst for the AI industry.\\nTherefore, AMD stock could be a great buy for any investor as we enter 2025. But considering the company is a top candidate to take some of Nvidia's market share in the data center industry, investors who own Nvidia stock could hedge some of that risk by buying into AMD.\\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn't one of them.

And people were saying it was overvalued then. Today, however, three companies boast valuations of more than $3 trillion -- Apple, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) -- and we should see several more join the fray over the next few years.\\nOne factor uniting the three members of the $3 trillion club is they\\'re all tied in one way or another to the growth in artificial intelligence. The next members of the group will likely benefit from growing spending and reliance on AI in business and everyday life. However, one company, in particular, stands to benefit greatly from its massive investments in AI, and that could lead its stock to double in value over the next few years, leading it to a $3 trillion market cap.\\nI see Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) joining the $3 trillion club by 2028. Here\\'s how AI will help it get there.\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nMeta\\'s business has long relied on artificial intelligence, aka \"the algorithm.\" The algorithm is responsible for determining what content to put in front of a user and when to do it, whether that\\'s a photo from a friend, a video from a professional content producer, or an ad from a small business. In fact, Meta used multiple machine learning systems to determine the best content recommendations for each type of content across its various apps and surfaces.\\nHowever, the success of large language models led it to change course. It\\'s now developing a generalized content recommendation system across all surfaces inspired by the power of large-scale large language models. And it works better than its old algorithms. Another upside of this development is a more efficient software engineering team, which can work on a unified model instead of a bunch of individual recommendation engines.\\nWith generative AI, Meta brings to the table the ability to help marketers craft hundreds of different iterations of their ads. It has the scale to test each of those ads across its platform and optimize the targeting and creative to deliver the best possible results. CEO Mark Zuckerberg sees a day when an advertiser will be able to simply tell Meta its business objective and budget, and it\\'ll take care of the rest. That would drive significant sales growth as it would open the doors for more marketers with smaller creative teams to advertise more on Facebook and Instagram.\\nMeta also introduced the ability for businesses to create their own AI chat agents in WhatsApp and Messenger last year. These represent an opportunity to finally monetize its messaging apps by giving businesses a way to interact with potential customers at scale.\\nFinally, generative AI has the potential to lead to more user-generated content. In fact, Meta introduced a new feature in Meta AI, its AI chatbot built into its apps, which lets users take AI-generated images and share them to their feed or stories, or post them as their Facebook profile picture. It\\'s not hiding the fact that these are AI-generated, either, encouraging users who see the images to make their own images based on the ones they like.\\nInvestors can draw a clear picture of how artificial intelligence can increase engagement across Meta\\'s apps, improve its monetization, and ultimately lead to more efficient engineers. All of that leads to tangible financial outcomes like greater revenue and improved profit margins. That\\'s a lot more than many big companies riding the AI wave can say.\\nMeta has a market cap of just under $1.5 trillion as of this writing. To reach $3 trillion by 2028, the stock will have to produce compound annual returns of about 20%. That seems within reach for the tech stock, especially if AI helps fuel faster earnings growth.\\nAnalysts are currently modeling a 15% increase in revenue next year. If Meta can continue to grow revenue at that pace for the following three years, it\\'ll be on a strong path toward a $3 trillion valuation.\\nIn the near term, Meta\\'s massive capital expenditures to support its AI development will weigh on its operating margin as more and more of its spending today shows up as depreciation expenses down the line. Over time, however, the impact of that spending will dissipate as Meta continues to grow. What\\'s more, since depreciation is a non-cash expense, it means free cash flow will remain strong, giving management the opportunity to buy back shares. Ultimately, that should lead to strong earnings-per-share growth and justify a high earnings multiple.\\nMeta shares currently trade for just 22.5 times analysts\\' 2025 earnings estimate. By comparison, Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia trade for 31.6, 32.5, and 32.6 times forward earnings estimates. If Meta\\'s earnings multiple expands slightly toward the mid-20s as it shows strong financial results and continues to buy back shares, it should produce returns strong enough to push it past the $3 trillion mark.\\nOf course, there\\'s no way to know for certain that Meta can reach that milestone. However, based on everything we know today, the company is poised to grow thanks to its advancements in AI, and the market is offering a great price on the stock.\\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A 13F allows investors to track which stocks Wall Street\\'s top money managers purchased and sold in the most recent quarter.\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nWith Berkshire Hathaway\\'s Warren Buffett overseeing a cumulative return of greater than 5,800,000% in his company\\'s Class A shares (BRK.A) since he became CEO in the mid-1960s, it\\'s no surprise that his trading activity is closely watched by investors. But he\\'s far from the only billionaire money manager with a successful investment track record or a following on Wall Street.\\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont has made quite a name for himself since founding Coatue Management in 1999. Laffont\\'s fund, which has a very clear focus on high-growth/innovative businesses in the tech space, closed out the September-ended quarter with close to $27 billion in AUM.\\nDespite running a relatively concentrated fund -- Coatue ended the third quarter with only 81 holdings -- there have been some eyepopping trades made of late by Laffont. In particular, he\\'s been dumping shares of two artificial intelligence (AI) leaders and is piling into one of Wall Street\\'s top-performing stock-split stocks.\\nOver the last two years, there hasn\\'t been a hotter trend on Wall Street than the rise of AI. According to the analysts at PwC, AI can add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. This is a big enough addressable market that there can be a multitude of winners -- and investors have wanted their piece of the pie.\\nBut in spite of this sky-high addressable market, Laffont and his top advisors have been persistently selling shares of two of Wall Street\\'s top artificial intelligence stocks, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD).\\nAccounting for Nvidia\\'s historic 10-for-1 stock split in June, Coatue has sold 39,663,859 shares of Nvidia over an 18-month stretch (March 31, 2023 through Sept. 30, 2024), which equates to an 80% reduction in its position. As for AMD, Laffont has overseen the sale of 4,249,190 shares over the same 18-month time frame, which works out to a 50% reduction in its stake.\\nAside from simple profit-taking, there are a couple of catalysts that may be encouraging Laffont and his team to ring the register on some of their top AI stocks.\\nHistory may offer one of the more compelling reasons why Coatue\\'s brightest minds are reducing their exposure to Nvidia and AMD. Inclusive of the advent of the internet, there hasn\\'t been a game-changing technology in at least 30 years that\\'s avoided an early stage bubble.\\nInvestors have a terrible habit of overestimating how quickly a new technology will be adopted and utilized. Every next-big-thing innovation needs ample time to mature, and we\\'re just not there yet with artificial intelligence. If the AI bubble were to burst, the \"brains\" of AI data centers (Nvidia and AMD) would almost certainly be clobbered.\\nThere may also be some degree of concern about gross margin at both companies. In particular, Nvidia\\'s gross margin has soared on account of scarcity for AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) and demand for its hardware handily outpacing supply. However, with AMD ramping up production of its Insight MI300X GPUs and introducing its next-generation MI325X GPU, scarcity should wane in the coming quarters.\\nTo add to this point, many of Nvidia\\'s largest customers by net sales -- i.e., members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- are internally developing GPUs to use in their data centers. Even though these chips are likely to lag Nvidia\\'s and AMD\\'s in computing capabilities, their mere existence is bound to take up valuable data center \"real estate\" and reduce pricing power (and gross margin) for Nvidia and AMD.\\nLastly, insiders have provided little in the way of encouragement for investors. It\\'s been almost four years since the last insider purchased shares on the open market at Nvidia. Meanwhile, no company executive or director at AMD has bought shares of their company on the open market in over a half-decade. If insiders fail to see value in their company\\'s stock, why should investors, or billionaire money managers, for that matter?\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nBut while Laffont has been persistently selling two of Wall Street\\'s leading AI companies, he\\'s been piling into shares of a top-performing consumer brand that completed a historic stock split in June. I\\'m talking about fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG), which conducted a 50-for-1 stock split.\\nAccording to Coatue\\'s 13F, 4,575,054 shares of Chipotle were purchased during the third quarter, which made it the 30th-largest position Laffont is overseeing in his fund\\'s nearly $27 billion portfolio.\\nSince its initial public offering price of $22 in January 2006, shares of Chipotle have catapulted higher by almost 13,900%, as of the closing bell on Nov. 29. These gains have been built atop a solid foundation of trust, pricing power, and innovation.\\nFor instance, Chipotle has pledged to use responsibly raised meats that are free of unnecessary antibiotics, and attempts to use locally sourced vegetables when it\\'s economically feasible to do so. For two decades, consumers have been fiercely loyal to Chipotle for taking these extra steps to ensure they receive higher-quality food.\\nTo build on the above, Chipotle\\'s Mexican Grill\\'s management team also realized long ago that its customers will gladly pay more if they\\'re receiving a superior product. Just as grocery stores benefited from a significant increase in demand for organic and natural foods two decades ago, Chipotle has had little issue passing along price hikes to deliver fresh food that\\'ll never see a freezer.\\nInnovation has also been vital to the company\\'s success. In 2018, it began rolling out its \"Chipotlane\" concept, which is a digital order-dedicated drive-thru lane. Chipotlanes came in especially handy during the COVID-19 pandemic and have since ushered in a new sales channel for the company.\\nHowever, Chipotle Mexican Grill\\'s path forward is a bit clouded. In August, Starbucks announced that it was pilfering Chipotle\\'s now-former CEO Brian Niccol to become its new chief. With things going so well from an operating standpoint, a change in the executive suite isn\\'t exactly something that comforts existing shareholders.\\nPerhaps the bigger concern is Chipotle\\'s valuation. Though there\\'s only so much innovation that can be squeezed out of the proverbial avocado, Chipotle is trading at an ultra-aggressive multiple of 47 times forward-year earnings.

Shares of the leading AI chipmaker are heading for a gain of about 170% this year and have climbed 2,300% over the past five years. This is thanks to Nvidia's triple-digit revenue growth quarter after quarter along with the company's commitment to innovation to stay ahead of rivals.\\nBut now, some of the world's most successful investors are unloading shares of Nvidia and turning to another AI player that potentially could soar in the coming quarters. Billionaires Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates, Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management, and Stanley Druckenmiller of the Duquesne Family Office each have made the same move. They've sold shares of Nvidia in favor of an AI player that, like Nvidia, completed a stock split this year.\\nThough this company has seen its stock climb about 40% in 2024, its valuation remains lower than Nvidia's, suggesting there may be plenty of room for this AI player's stock to run. Let's find out more about the billionaires' moves and the potential of this stock they piled into in the third quarter.\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nSo which stock are these investors potentially viewing as the next big AI winner? The answer is Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), a networking giant that's seen demand for its products take off along with the AI boom. Before I talk about the Broadcom story, here are the details of the billionaires' recent moves:\\nIt's important to note that Dalio and Laffont still own millions of Nvidia shares. Clearly, they continue to believe in the company's potential for gains. And Druckenmiller actually said in a Bloomberg interview that he regrets his sale of Nvidia and would consider buying the stock again at the right valuation. So these investors haven't given up on the AI chip powerhouse.\\nThat said, they're betting that Broadcom may be one of the next winners in this AI revolution. Broadcom is a company that powers a lot of the technology around us, selling thousands of products used in data center networking, home connectivity, smartphones, and more.\\nThis has helped the company increase earnings over time, but in recent quarters, it's the area of AI that's started to represent the next big growth driver. In the latest quarter, for example, Broadcom said demand from major cloud service providers for AI networking and custom AI accelerators helped drive a 47% increase in revenue. This is as these customers build out and scale their operations. Considering growth prospects for the entire AI market -- with forecasts of a $1 trillion market by the end of the decade -- there's likely plenty of growth ahead. Broadcom is already increasing near-term expectations as it now forecasts $12 billion in fiscal 2024 AI revenue, up from earlier forecasts for $11 billion.\\nBroadcom completed a 10-for-1 stock split this year, a move that doesn't change anything fundamental about the company. But it is positive because, by lowering the per-share price, it opens up the investment opportunity to a wider range of investors.\\nMeanwhile, in spite of Broadcom's gain this year, the stock only trades for 25 times forward earnings estimates, a bargain considering its prospects in the high-growth AI market in the years to come. And Broadcom looks particularly cheap compared to Nvidia, which trades for about 45 times forward earnings.\\nAll of this means it's no surprise that billionaires have locked in some gains in Nvidia stock and turned to Broadcom as a new source of potential growth. And the great news is you don't have to be a billionaire to pick up a few Broadcom shares right now and bet on the company's future in the exciting AI market.\\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn't one of them.

Recently, Left went short on Michael Saylor\\'s company, MicroStrategy, suggesting that the data company and large buyer of Bitcoin is now trading detached from Bitcoin fundamentals. The call is interesting because Citron and Left four years ago said MicroStrategy was the best way to gain exposure to Bitcoin, although part of the short thesis is due to expanding access to Bitcoin.\\nLeft is now making another bold call, claiming he\\'s found Wall Street\\'s next artificial intelligence (AI) darling. The call conveniently occurred on the same day that AI chip king Nvidia participated in a $700 million private placement for the company that also included the venture capital giant Accel and global investment firm Orbis Investments. Let\\'s meet this new potential AI darling and see if it is as promising as Left says.\\nCitron\\'s shoutout and Nvidia\\'s investment may have been the first time you heard of the AI infrastructure company Nebius Group (NASDAQ: NBIS). How is that possible? Well, Nebius has been on an interesting journey.\\nUntil October, the stock hadn\\'t traded on the public markets for three years. That\\'s because the Amsterdam-based company used to be owned by a Russian search engine giant called Yandex. Following Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Russian-affiliated companies. Earlier this year, the international assets were split off from Yandex in a $5.4 billion deal. Nebius was manifested to bear four divisions including cloud, data labeling, self-driving automobiles, and education technology, and Nebius began trading on the Nasdaq again on Oct. 21.\\nNebius is part of a growing list of companies that rent their infrastructure to AI companies. Powering AI is expensive and energy-intensive because it involves storing vast data quantities and hardware that powers AI language models. Nebius provides computing capabilities, storage, and tools and services for developers. The company\\'s core AI platform is intended to handle massive AI workloads. Companies looking to develop AI capabilities can pay a subscription to use the infrastructure offered by companies like Nebius.\\nIt didn\\'t take long for investors to discover Nebius -- the stock is up 55% on the year following the Nvidia news and plug from Citron. In a post on X, Citron\\'s account called Nebius \"a sleeper with no analyst coverage yet, the market hasn\\'t caught on to its massive potential -- or its undervaluation vs. CoreWeave.\" CoreWeave is another AI infrastructure company rumored to be preparing a public offering that could value the company at $35 billion. If Nebius trades at a 50% discount to CoreWeave, that results in a $60 stock price, according to Citron. Nebius traded below $28 when Citron posted about it on Dec. 3.\\nCitron also said that CEO Arkady Volozh, who resigned from the company after the initial sanctions but is now back, \"is the real deal.\" The researcher also said that Nvidia had been waiting for the company to complete the spin-off from its Russian parent to announce the deal. Interestingly, Nebius on its website says its customers will be some of the first to use Nvidia\\'s next-generation Blackwell platform. Nebius projects revenue will grow 200% to 300% in 2025 to a range of $500 million to $700 million. The company plans to spend anywhere from $600 million to $1.5 billion for more capacity at its data centers in Finland, France, and North America.\\nIt\\'s always nice to find stocks you are interested in before they receive coverage on the Street. Wall Street analysts have the ears of many institutional investors at large funds that can move the needle, although the Nvidia investment and attention from Citron preempted some of this.\\nNebius is not yet profitable, but is growing revenue rapidly and has about $2.3 billion of cash on its balance sheet and very little debt. Nebius also operates in a huge market and already has some kind of partnership with Nvidia. Let\\'s also not forget that it\\'s in one of the hottest sectors of the stock market receiving huge valuations. Investors can certainly take a starter position. There may be some push and pull given the company\\'s background, but the stock looks cheap compared to other AI names.\\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

That wasn\\'t always the case. Just 20 years ago, General Electric and ExxonMobile were the leaders in terms of market cap, valued at $319 billion and $283 billion, respectively.\\nThese days, technology rules the roost. Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft are each worth more than $3 trillion and led the leaderboard at some point in 2024. Other big tech members of the $1 trillion club are also household names, including Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms, with valuations of between $1.5 trillion and $2.3 trillion.\\nWith a market cap of roughly $797 billion (as of this writing), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) seems a shoo-in for membership in this exclusive fraternity. The company supplies a broad cross-section of products that are critical components in data center infrastructure, where most AI processing takes place, and its indispensable technology could be the fuel that drives Broadcom\\'s successful quest for membership.\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nAs well as being one of the world\\'s foremost custom chipmakers, Broadcom also offers a host of complementary products and services in the mobile, cable, broadband, and data center segments. The company states that \"99% of all internet traffic crosses through some type of Broadcom technology.\" This extensive reach illustrates why Broadcom\\'s technology is a critical part of the generative AI ecosystem, as the technology lives primarily in the cloud and in data centers.\\nBeyond AI, investors continue to underestimate the opportunity represented by Broadcom\\'s purchase of VMWare late last year. During the recentearnings call management noted that \"VMWare bookings continue to accelerate,\" amounting to $2.5 billion in Q3, up 32% sequentially.\\nFurthermore, the company continues to drive down VMWare spending. CEO Hock Tan noted that with the VMWare integration proceeding as expected, Broadcom was on track to deliver on its goal of $8.5 billion in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) by 2025. Once the process is complete, the company expects to deliver expanding margins and increasing profits.\\nThe results highlight an intriguing opportunity. For its fiscal third quarter (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom delivered revenue of $13.1 billion, which jumped 47% year over year, while its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased 18% to $1.24. Management expects this upward trajectory to continue, increasing its full-year revenue forecast to $51.5 billion, representing growth of 44%.\\nThis adds to Broadcom\\'s long history of strong business and financial performance, which has fueled its surging stock price. This, in turn, led the company to declare a 10-for-1 stock split earlier this year, which it completed in July.\\nBroadcom\\'s chips and ancillary products -- critical components in data center operations -- give the company an important role in supplying the AI ecosystem. Broadcom is in an enviable position, which will be a key driver in the next stage of its growth.\\nWall Street expects Broadcom to generate revenue of $51.7 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 15. If the stock\\'s P/S remains constant, Broadcom will need to generate sales of roughly $65 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap.\\nAnalysts\\' consensus estimates are guiding for revenue growth of 44% in 2024 and 17% in 2025. If the company hits those targets, it will likely achieve a $1 trillion market cap as soon as mid-2026. That said, I believe Wall Street\\'s growth estimates are conservative, as Broadcom has exceeded analysts\\' expectations in each of the past three quarters. Therefore, it isn\\'t unreasonable to expect more of the same over the coming year.\\nAccelerating AI spending and the growing adoption of VMWare should give Broadcom multiple paths for robust growth next year, which is why I believe 2025 is a more likely timeframe for the company to join the trillionaire club.\\nObservations by management seem to support that, as Broadcom is experiencing \"strong demand from hyperscalers for both AI networking and custom AI accelerators.\" Furthermore, commentary from the world\\'s largest cloud infrastructure providers suggests demand won\\'t be slowing for the foreseeable future.\\nEstimates for the size of the AI market continue to climb, but even the more conservative estimates are compelling. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, generative AI is expected to be a $1.3 trillion market by 2032. McKinsey & Company places the economic impact at between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually. While no one knows for sure just how big the AI opportunity will ultimately be, most experts agree it will be much higher than it is today.\\nDespite Broadcom\\'s impressive gains, it remains attractively priced, currently selling for just 27 times forward earnings, compared to a multiple of 30 for the S&P 500. That\\'s not a bad price for a stock that\\'s delivered total returns (including dividends) of 14,500% since 2009, especially when compared to a gain of just 633% for the broader market.\\nThat\\'s why Broadcom stock is a buy.\\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn\\'t one of them.

In addition, the research found, many companies with at least $1 billion in annual revenue are committed to expanding their GenAI investments in the coming year.\\nMore recently, PYMNTS examined how chief marketing officers (CMOs) are leveraging GenAI for better customer service.\\nPYMNTS Intelligence data showed that 97% of CMOs surveyed in July found the technology highly effective for this purpose, compared to 72% in April.\\n'This surge underscores how GenAI is optimizing customer service workflows rather than replacing human agents. Automated tools powered by generative AI handle routine queries and requests, freeing customer service teams to focus on complex issues requiring a human touch,' PYMNTS wrote. 'This balance has proven particularly advantageous in the payments sector, where fast, accurate responses are crucial to maintaining customer trust.'\\nIn addition, GenAI plays a key role in providing real-time, automated responses to customer queries, though its effectiveness lies in its collaborative potential.\\n'For instance, an AI-driven chatbot might handle initial troubleshooting before escalating unresolved issues to a human representative,' PYMNTS wrote.

This stellar rise puts NVIDIA at the forefront of the semiconductor industry, handily outpacing the Zacks Semiconductor – General industry's 127.5% gain and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK - Free Report) ETF's 22.6% climb.\\nYTD Price Return Performance\\nNVIDIA's meteoric rise is anchored in its leadership in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI. As businesses increasingly adopt AI to boost productivity, demand for NVIDIA's advanced graphic processing units (GPUs), which power these applications, has surged.\\nAccording to Fortune Business Insights, the global generative AI market is projected to skyrocket to $967.6 billion by 2032 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 39.6% from 2024. This rapid expansion makes NVIDIA's GPUs indispensable for companies investing in AI infrastructure.\\nNVIDIA's cutting-edge technology delivers unmatched computational power, enabling large-scale AI models to perform intricate calculations. With generative AI applications spanning industries such as healthcare, automotive and manufacturing, NVIDIA is positioned to dominate this space for years.\\nNVIDIA's Diversified Growth Across Industries\\nNVIDIA's influence extends well beyond AI. The company's GPUs are integral to advancements in sectors like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing. In automotive, NVIDIA's solutions contribute to the development of autonomous vehicles, a market expected to experience rapid growth over the next decade. In healthcare, NVIDIA's GPUs are revolutionizing medical diagnostics, enhancing imaging processes and improving patient care. This broad, multi-industry applicability positions NVIDIA as a resilient and diverse growth engine in the tech landscape.\\nMoreover, NVIDIA's robust data center solutions are gaining traction. As companies invest in cloud and edge computing, demand for powerful data center infrastructure rises, making NVIDIA's data center business a critical growth driver. This sector alone is projected to significantly boost the company's revenues as businesses accelerate their digital transformation efforts, solidifying NVIDIA's long-term growth potential.\\nNVIDIA's Robust Financial Performance Highlights Strength\\nNVIDIA's financial results underscore its dominance. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the company reported a staggering 94% year-over-year revenue increase, paired with a 103% jump in non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS). For the fourth quarter, management expects revenues to soar to $37.5 billion, up from $22.1 billion in the prior-year quarter.\\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA's fiscal 2025 and 2026 revenues and earnings points to sustained growth, reflecting confidence in the company's market leadership across multiple sectors, including gaming, automotive and professional visualization.\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\nThis financial prowess is reflected in NVIDIA's strong balance sheet. As of Oct. 27, 2024, the company held $38.4 billion in cash, up from $34.8 billion on July 28. Over the first three quarters of fiscal 2025, NVIDIA generated $47.5 billion in operating cash flow and $45.2 billion in free cash flow.\\nThis financial stability not only supports ongoing innovation but also provides a cushion against market volatility, ensuring NVIDIA can capitalize on emerging opportunities.\\nNVIDIA's Discounted Valuation Amid Growth\\nDespite its remarkable run, NVIDIA's valuation remains attractive. The stock trades at a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 35.15, below the Zacks Semiconductor – General industry average of 37.83. This suggests the stock is trading at a relative discount, offering potential upside for investors.\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\nNVIDIA: In a Nutshell\\nNVIDIA's 180% YTD surge is impressive, but its growth trajectory is far from over. The company's leadership in AI, diversified applications and robust financial performance position it as a cornerstone of the semiconductor and technology sectors.\\nFor investors seeking exposure to the AI revolution and beyond, NVIDIA represents a compelling opportunity. The stock's long-term prospects and attractive valuation make it a must-buy for those looking to ride the wave of technological innovation.\\nNVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2, offer the best investment opportunities for investors.

            "Asset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\n",
            "Right now, SurModics has an S/TA ratio of 0.7, which means that the company gets $0.7 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.61, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\n",

            "Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n",

            "CEO Alex Karp took a victory lap following his company's most recent earnings, saying the results were so strong that \"I almost feel like we should just go home.\" Later he took a swipe at any critics who challenged his sanity in making such a comment.\n",
            "But while Karp has been celebrating the success of his company and its stock, he has also been aggressively selling shares of Palantir. This of course begs the question, should investors follow Karp's lead and sell Palantir stock?\n",
            "Karp has been a pretty consistent seller of Palantir stock since late 2020, using what is called a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Under these plans, company executives and other insiders set up selling instructions to brokers to sell shares based on a variety of parameters. It can be as simple as selling a set amount of shares on set dates regardless of price, or it could use a set of much more complicated triggers.\n",
            "Karp appears to be using a more complicated set of triggers, but whatever they are have led to a huge increase in selling by the CEO in the couple of months. All of these recent sales have been through the exercise and then sale of stock options.\n",
            "Karp's increased selling began in mid-September when he exercised options and sold 9 million shares at an average price of $36.18, worth $325.6 million.\n",
            "Just ahead of earnings he exercised options and sold an additional 5.66 million shares at an average price of $45.01, taking home $254.6 million. Then immediately after earnings, he exercised options and sold more than 12.3 million shares at an average price of $52.71, good for proceeds of $650.6 million.\n",
            "Before the acceleration in selling, Karp's sales were more in the $15 million to $22 million range.\n",
            "Karp wasn't the only insider to sell shares after earnings. Chief Accounting Officer Heather Planishek and Director Lauren Friedman Stat also sold shares via 10b5-1 plans.\n",
            "This isn't the first time Palantir has seen big insider selling, with Chairman Peter Thiel setting up a Rule 10b5-1 plan and quickly disposing of more than 28.5 million shares in September and early October.\n",
            "Image source: Getty Images.\n",
            "Palantir is undoubtedly a great company. It initially proved itself by providing data gathering and analytic services to the U.S. government and helping it with such mission-critical tasks as fighting terrorism and tracking COVID-19 cases. It has since become a big artificial intelligence (AI) winner, with the U.S. commercial sector now embracing its AI platform.\n",
            "Palantir's big AI push into the commercial sector has helped it see accelerating revenue growth, with revenue jumping 30% year over year last quarter. It was the company's fifth straight quarter of revenue growth acceleration, demonstrating the momentum its solutions have. The U.S. commercial sector led the way with a 54% increase in revenue, or 59% when excluding strategic commercial contracts. U.S. government revenue, meanwhile, soared 40% year over year, as the government also has started to embrace its AI solutions.\n",
            "Right now, the company is doing a great job of both bringing in new customers and expanding with existing customers. However, the biggest issue when it comes to Palantir stock is not its operational performance, it's with Palantir's valuation. Following the recent surge in stock price, the stock now trades at a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 41 times 2025 analyst estimates.\n",
            "PLTR PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts\n",
            "For a stock growing its revenue by around 30%, that valuation is pretty extreme. While Palantir is a great company, at some point valuation does matter. CEO Alex Karp seems to recognize this as well, which is why he has accelerated his selling of the stock in recent months.\n",
            "Back in August, I wrote that it was not too late to buy Palantir stock. With this latest surge in price, I'm stepping back from that view. I think the smart thing to do currently is to follow the lead of Karp and other insiders and take some profits in the stock after a great run.\n",

            "Article: Super Micro Computer stock (NASDAQ: SMCI) is seeing a real possibility of being delisted from the Nasdaq in the coming days. The company faces a November 16th deadline to either file its delayed 10-K annual report or submit a plan with the SEC to regain compliance. Things don't look good for the server hardware major given that it doesn't have a public accounting firm to sign off on its financial statements after Ernst & Young resigned as its accountant in October. So if you're a Super Micro shareholder, what are your options at this point? For context, this isn't the first time Super Micro has faced delisting. Back in 2018, it was removed from the Nasdaq after an SEC investigation into its revenue recognition practices. It wasn't until around two years later, after settling with the SEC, that it was relisted. So, what happens if SMCI stock gets delisted yet again? See our analysis Will Super Micro Stock Be Delisted?\n",
            "SMCI stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 3 years. Returns for the stock were 39% in 2021, 87% in 2022, and 246% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. So what lies ahead for Super Micro stock and its investors?\n",
            "If Super Micro stock is delisted, investors will still hold their stock, although trading will move to so-called 'Pink sheets,' which are traded on the over-the-counter markets. There are a couple of drawbacks to OTC stocks though. Trading costs become higher. Liquidity in these markets is also lower, with fewer buyers and sellers. While all major retail brokerages offer trading of OTC stocks, transaction costs are higher due to increased fees and potentially wider bid-ask spreads, meaning that investors might end up paying more or selling for less than they would have liked to. Further, the regulations governing OTC markets are less strict than those on major exchanges. This can translate into even less transparency for investors, which is risky for stocks like Super Micro which are faced with accusations of accounting irregularities. When stocks are traded on an exchange, they are held to certain listing standards by regulators, but this isn't the case with delisted stocks.\n",
            "So yes, investors will still be able to hold SMCI stock even if it gets delisted. But the real question probably is, should they? On the face of it, Super Micro's core business appears to have been doing well. The company, which sells server systems, and management software, and provides installation and maintenance services, is benefiting from a surge in demand led by the generative AI trend. Revenues more than doubled in FY'24 and consensus estimates point to another 80% jump in revenue for this fiscal year. See Trump's Surprise Boost To AI Stocks.\n",
            "That said, it's probably a good idea to stay cautious with SMCI right now as investors face fundamental questions as to whether they can actually trust the financial numbers. Multiple red flags have been raised, and if the company's statements aren't accurate, one could be making decisions based on faulty information. If the stock is delisted and moved to the OTC market, its stock price and earnings multiple could be hit further. This is what happened the last time the company was delisted in 2018 and this could very well happen again. There are also concerns about how these issues could impact Super Micro's core business. Customers might start pulling back on their orders as they might be uneasy about signing contracts with a company facing financial uncertainty. Suppliers could become skittish as well. Take Nvidia, for instance. The GPU major could start thinking twice about sending their much sought-after GPUs to Super Micro, opting to boost supply to other more stable players such as Dell instead. If that happens, Super Micro's revenues and profits could be impacted further. In addition, see should you Buy, Sell, or Hold Nvidia stock?\n",

This followed an upwardly revised 0.8% increase in September. However, the Labor Department also reported that import prices unexpectedly rose 0.3% in October, reversing September's 0.4% decline, due to higher prices for fuels and other goods.\n",

            "Article: These three stocks offer investors huge dividend potential for many years. The Global X MLP ETF (NYSEMKT: MLPA) invests in master limited partnerships (MLPs) in midstream pipelines and storage. Meanwhile, Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) and Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG) are oil and gas exploration and production companies set to gush cash in 2025 and use it to enhance dividends for long-term investors.\n",
            "Whether you voted for President Trump or not, he will take office in January. That's good news for gas pipelines and storage companies, not least because the Trump administration has promised to end the moratorium on new LNG export terminal licenses imposed by the Biden administration.\n",
            "While investors may enjoy picking winners in the sector, the Global X MLP ETF offers an alternative option. Currently holding 20 MLPs with Energy Transfer, Enterprise Product Partners, and MPLX each representing more than 10% of assets, the ETF offers a relatively stress-free way to get broad-based exposure to midstream pipelines and storage companies.\n",
            "In addition to the new administration's approach to LNG terminals, an increase in energy exploration and production is good news for energy infrastructure companies because it increases the likelihood of output increases in the fields they serve. That helps de-risk MLPs and improves their bargaining position when negotiating long-term contracts.\n",
            "Image source: Getty Images.\n",
            "This ETF, with an 8.3% dividend yield and an expense ratio of 0.45%, is a buy for investors who are optimistic about the long-term future of energy production in the U.S.\n",
            "I know what you are thinking: Devon Energy didn't pay a variable dividend in the third quarter, and its quarterly fixed dividend of $0.22 equates to an annual dividend of $0.88. That figure would put Devon on a dividend yield of just 2.3%, so how is Devon Energy a high-yield stock?\n",
            "The answer lies in understanding how capital is best returned to shareholders over time. In a nutshell, Devon Energy's management is currently using its substantive cash flow to reduce its debt and make share buybacks after it pays its quarterly fixed dividend. It's a strategy that makes sense when it's gushing cash flow from good production and a relatively high price of oil. The debt reduction will improve future cash flow as it won't have to pay the interest on the retirement debt, and the share buybacks will lower the share count, so existing shareholders will have a more significant claim on future cash flow.\n",
            "Putting some numbers to this argument, management believes it will have a free cash flow (FCF) yield of 9% in 2025 based on a price of oil of $70 a barrel and the stock price on Nov. 1 of around $38.32. Interpolating for the current stock price suggests an FCF yield of 8.9%. In theory, Devon could pay all of that in dividends. However, management tends to return 70% of FCF to investors, with 30% earmarked to improve its balance sheet (debt reduction).\n",
            "Image source: Getty Images.\n",
            "As such, if 70% of returns are in the form of dividends, this implies a 6.2% dividend yield. That would be fine, but given that the stock trades on such an attractive FCF yield, it makes more sense to use investors' money to buy back stock yielding 8.9% in FCF.\n",
            "As such, provided FCF stays high, Devon will have plenty of potential to increase its dividend significantly, not least as FCF per share will drop given the share count reduction.\n",
            "In common with Devon, Diamondback Energy didn't pay a variable dividend in the third quarter. Also in common with Devon, which acquired Bakken-focused Grayson Mill, Diamondback is expanding its production through a merger with Permian-focused Endeavor Energy (expected to close in the fourth quarter).\n",
            "The parallels don't stop there. Diamondback also expects to gush cash flow in 2024, with management forecasting $3.4 billion at commodity currency prices. It's an FCF representing 6.4% of the current market cap. The market is likely valuing Diamondback over Devon due to the Endeavor deal.\n",
            "Indeed, there's good news on that front, with management recently lowering its post-dividend breakeven price of oil to $37 a barrel from an initial estimate of $40 a barrel.\n",
            "Image source: Getty Images.\n",
            "In plain English, provided the price of oil stays above $37 a barrel, Diamondback will be able to pay its base quarterly dividend of $0.90, or $3.60 a year. That equates to a 2% dividend yield. However, given that the price of oil is currently around $70 a barrel, and management takes an opportunistic approach (just as Devon does) in making share buybacks when its valuation is low or increasing its variable dividend where possible, the stock has plenty of potential to grow its dividend in the coming years.\n",
            "All told, the Global X MLP ETF offers excellent dividend yields now. If you believe energy prices will hold up, then Devon and Diamondback are likely to return to increasing their variable dividends in the future.\n",

            "Home Depot stock (NYSE: HD), the world's largest home improvement retailer, fell marginally 1.3% on Tuesday, 12th November (to $403), as compared to a 0.3% decline in the S&P 500 index. In comparison, HD's peer Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) saw its stock down 1.7% to around $270 on the same day. Home Depot reported that the company beat revenue growth for Q3 thanks, in part, to hurricane activity and increased demand from areas impacted by hurricanes, but it experienced a decline in net earnings. The company's net sales grew 7% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $40.2 billion while adjusted EPS of $3.78 fell 4.3% y-o-y but still managed to beat estimates.\n",
            "Rising interest rates and economic unpredictability have led to consumer caution, resulting in a 1.3% decline in comparable sales for the third quarter. This shift in consumer behavior has negatively impacted foot traffic and average transaction values, which decreased slightly to $88.65 in Q3 2024, indicating budget constraints among customers. It should be noted that the company's operating margin fell 800 basis points y-o-y to 13.5%, due to increased supply chain investments to facilitate its online orders.\n",
            "The Federal Reserve continued to raise interest rates aggressively since 2022 to fight inflation (until September 2024 when it announced its rate cuts). Consequently, this has translated to higher mortgage rates, which in turn suppressed home sales. After hitting a 2022 high mortgage rate of 7.08% in November, rates started trending down. Currently, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.79% as of 11th November, up from 6.08% the year before.\n",
            "The dropping home prices could be a drag for Home Depot on a short-term basis, but the company's stock could see a higher upside in the longer term. It should be noted that the company, with more than 2300 locations, generates more sales from professional contractors than its rival Lowe's does, and that diversity is helpful at a time when many consumers are pulling back on home project spending. Also, it is fair to assume homeowners will continue spending to maintain their properties. The lowering of interest rates could provide some relief to weary home buyers tired of higher mortgage rates. Furthermore, lower rates will encourage homebuilders to build more as they will reduce borrowing costs and make it easier for consumers to utilize home equity lines of credit.\n",
            "The increase in HD stock over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 60% in 2021, -22% in 2022, and 13% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period.\n",
            "Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could HD face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months – or will it see a strong jump?\n",
            "Home Depot's management has provided guidance for the fiscal year, predicting a 2.5% decline in comparable sales for FY 2024. Nevertheless, the company expects total revenue to increase by 4%, fueled by acquisitions and infrastructure enhancements. Margin pressures are anticipated to result in a 2% year-end decline in EPS.\n",
            "We have revised HD's Valuation to $404 per share, based on a $14.84 expected EPS and a 27.2x P/E multiple for the fiscal year 2024 – almost inline with the current market price. We forecast HD's Revenues to be $157.4 billion for the fiscal year 2024, up 3% y-o-y.\n",

            "While the historical EPS growth rate for Graham is 8.8%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 145.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 3.6%.\n",
            "Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\n",
            "Right now, Graham has an S/TA ratio of 0.83, which means that the company gets $0.83 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.76, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\n",
            "While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Graham is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 11.8% this year versus the industry average of 0%.\n",
            "Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n",
            "There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Graham. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 8.4% over the past month.\n",

The analyst also raised its Q4 and 2025 estimates for the company.\n",

Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n",

The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 26 cents per share to 27 cents in that period.\n",

            "After Americans elected Donald Trump president for a second time last week, with little of the chaos many expected, stocks 'melted up.'\n",
            "The small-cap Russell 2000 led the way, soaring 8.6% higher. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both gained 4.6%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 5.7%.\n",
            "There were three catalysts here.\n",
            "First, like we said, was the presidential election. The Republicans have secured control of the Senate and the House. Combine that with Trump's substantial margin in both the Electoral College and popular vote, and that creates a pretty compelling mandate to govern.\n",
            "In other words, we can expect Trump to make pro-business reforms and initiatives to stimulate economic growth priorities – and that has Wall Street and Main Street excited.\n",
            "In fact, InvestorPlace CEO Brian Hunt recently made a compelling case for why stocks should do terrific in a new Trump administration. Whether you love Trump or hate him, Brian argues that you may as well settle in and prepare for the gains to come. (You can read Brian's essay in full here.)\n",
            "The second catalyst is the Federal Reserve. Last Thursday, November 7, the Fed unanimously decided to cut key interest rates by 0.25%. While the Fed hinted that it may have to start curtailing key interest rate cuts in its official policy statement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell also noted that Fed policy was 'still restrictive.' So, if the Fed wants to move to a 'neutral' level, that implies it will cut rates at least one more time. Whether that comes in December or in 2025, we'll simply just have to see what the next inflation and jobs reports reveal.\n",
            "The third catalyst is an early 'January effect.'\n",
            "Today, let's 'drill down' on that third catalyst. We'll discuss what exactly an early January effect is… and why I expect stocks to head even higher in the near term.\n",
            "But… not all stocks are going to head higher. We can't become complacent and start throwing darts at a board.\n",
            "So, I'll also reveal which stocks should emerge as the market leaders… and tell you more about the system I use that helps me find them.\n",
            "Essentially, an early 'January effect' occurs when folks pour money into the market. Whether it's people adding money to their retirement accounts, employers contributing to their employees' retirement savings, or financial gifts… This all usually happens before the end of the year.\n",
            "It makes sense when you think about it… People tend to do a little financial housekeeping at the end of the year, before later trying to start the New Year off on the right foot.\n",
            "And these contributions tend to boost small- and mid-cap stocks.\n",
            "Now, typically, stocks need to 'back and fill' and digest their gains. And that's exactly what we've experienced the past couple days. On Tuesday, the Russell 2000 declined 1.8%, the S&P slipped 0.3%, the Dow dropped 0.9%, and the Nasdaq dipped about 0.09%. Then, on Wednesday, the action was a little more muted.\n",
            "The good news is I expect stocks to bounce back soon. Historically, stocks tend to rally in the weeks and days leading up to Thanksgiving. Bespoke Investment Group recently reported that the S&P 500 has risen an average of 3.81% in November in the past 10 years.\n",
            "The reason is simple. Folks are in a more positive mood during the holiday season. And when consumers are happy, investors are also happy.\n",
            "I anticipate that the stock market will continue to meander higher in the coming weeks and months, fueled by an early January effect. And I look for fundamentally superior stocks – like the ones I recommend in Accelerated Profits – to lead the market higher.\n",
            "Case in point: Paymentus Holdings, Inc. (PAY). The company reported quarterly results after the market closed on Tuesday that crushed analysts' earnings and revenue estimates.\n",
            "For the third quarter, the payments tech company reported earnings of $19.6 million, or $0.15 per share, and record revenue of $231.6 million. That represented 79.5% year-over-year earnings growth and 51.9% year-over-year revenue growth.\n",
            "The consensus estimate called for earnings of $0.09 per share on $190.63 million in revenue. So, Paymentus topped analysts' earnings estimates by 66.7% and revenue forecasts by 21.5%.\n",
            "Company management noted that it ended the 'excellent' third quarter with strong bookings and a robust backlog. It expects fourth-quarter revenue between $215.0 million and $220.0 million, which is up from $164.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and nicely higher than analysts' current projections for $203.62 million.\n",
            "As a result, PAY surged 27% higher on Wednesday. You can see the impact of that spike in the chart below…\n",
            "This wasn't just a one-off occurrence, either.\n",

            "Article: Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ: DJT) stock could become a hot buy after Donald Trump's election win last week. As the former president heads back to the Oval Office next year, there could be a lot more excitement around Trump Media stock and anything related to the Trump brand.\n",
            "If there's also more traffic on Trump Media's social media platform Truth Social and its recently launched streaming service Truth+, investors could see improved results for the company. Is the stage set for this volatile stock to get back to the highs it reached earlier this year?\n",
            "Earlier this year, Trump Media stock was rising in value as hopes appeared to be growing that Trump might win the election, and it was falling when that excitement seemed to be waning. Now that he won, a wave of bullishness could be ignited, leading to a more prolonged rally. Interest does appear to be picking up, as the trading volume of Trump Media stock increased significantly in recent days.\n",
            "DJT Volume data by YCharts.\n",
            "The big question is whether the social media stock will trade like a cryptocurrency and become a gauge of Trump's overall popularity (and perhaps approval as president), or if its valuation will ultimately depend on how strong and successful the underlying business is. If it's the former, the possibility exists that the stock will hit its high of $79.38, but if it's the latter, that may be a less likely scenario.\n",
            "On Election Day, Trump Media posted its most recent quarterly results. The company, which owns Truth Social, reported net sales of just over $1 million for the period ending Sept. 30, which was a 6% decline year over year. That's not what you would expect for a growing business.\n",
            "Its operating loss swelled to $23.7 million from just $3 million in the same period last year. The company's general and administrative expenses jumped from $1.5 million in the prior-year period to $17.7 million this quarter, as Trump Media experienced an increase in legal, software, accounting, and finance fees.\n",
            "The timing of the underwhelming results may have been convenient, as Trump Media's earnings weren't the biggest Trump-related news on the day. But the numbers are important to consider, nonetheless, as they underscore the risk that comes with investing in the business. If Trump Media's expenses are increasing significantly and it's not able to generate meaningful growth, it could be difficult to see the stock rise in value, based on its fundamentals, or be optimistic about its future growth prospects.\n",
            "Trump Media may seem like a stock that should benefit from Trump's election win, but that's by no means a sure thing. In the days following the election, the stock dropped in value by a few dollars per share.\n",
            "How it performs from here can be difficult to predict. It's been trading more like a cryptocurrency and speculative buy than a typical stock this year. It's difficult to justify the stock's market cap of $6.6 billion based on its financial performance and growth prospects.\n",
            "Trump Media stock may get back to its highs, but if it does, it likely won't be because the business has been generating strong results -- it'll be due to speculation. That's why I wouldn't suggest buying the stock, as it's a highly risky investment with an uncertain future.\n",

This should bode well for Qualcomm as Samsung is the world's largest vendor of smartphones with a market share of 18% in the third quarter of 2024, according to Canalys.\n",

With Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite processor capable of powering on-device generative AI applications, it is easy to see why Samsung may be tempted to shift all of its Galaxy S25 smartphones to this processor.\n",
            "Even better, Qualcomm points out that other smartphone OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) such as ASUS, Honor, iQOO, Motorola, Nubia, OnePlus, OPPO, RedMagic, Redmi, Realme, Samsung, Vivo, Xiaomi, ZTE, and more \"are poised to launch devices powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite, in the coming weeks.\"\n",
            "What this means is that Qualcomm is in a solid position to benefit from the secular growth of the generative AI smartphone market, which is expected to clock 78% annual growth through 2028 and hit annual shipments of 912 million units at the end of the forecast period, according to IDC. More importantly, Qualcomm is the second largest player in the smartphone application processor market with a share of 31%, according to Counterpoint Research.\n",
            "Qualcomm has been taking share away from market leader MediaTek in recent quarters, a trend that's likely to continue as Counterpoint estimates that Qualcomm could capture more than 50% of the generative AI smartphone market. MediaTek, on the other hand, is expected to corner only a 13% share of the generative AI smartphone market. So, it won't be surprising to see Qualcomm enjoy stronger growth in the new fiscal year and in the long run.\n",
            "Analysts have bumped up their earnings expectations for Qualcomm for the new fiscal year that has just begun, and also for fiscal 2026. This can be seen in the chart below.\n",

            "Assuming Qualcomm does generate $11.21 per share in earnings in fiscal 2025 and trades at 30 times forward earnings after a year (in line with the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 index's forward earnings multiple), its stock price could hit $336. That would be nearly double of the current stock price. However, Qualcomm has a forward earnings multiple of just 15, which means that investors are getting a solid discount on this semiconductor stock right now.\n",

            "Article: Crexendo (CXDO) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.\n",
            "The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.\n",
            "Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.\n",
            "As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Crexendo is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.\n",
            "The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.\n",
            "Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Crexendo imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.\n",
            "Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n",
            "The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\n",
            "For the fiscal year ending December 2024, this company is expected to earn $0.24 per share, which is unchanged compared with the year-ago reported number.\n",
            "Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Crexendo. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 3.7%.\n",
            "Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\n",

            "Medical Properties Trust (MPT), a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on the healthcare sector, is an excellent example of why dividend investors shouldn't just chase high yields. The company's forward yield of 6.91% is high by any market standard -- it is substantially above the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) average of 1.32%.\n",
            "But there is more to the story. Not long ago, MPT's yield was more than twice that until the company cut its payouts twice in one year. What happened?\n",
            "The company encountered issues as one of its major tenants, Steward Healthcare, couldn't pay its rent. REITs must distribute at least 90% of their taxable income as dividends, so MPT can't legally suspend its payouts altogether. But investors want to see dividends grow, not shrink. Steward Healthcare, MPT's troubled tenant, has filed for bankruptcy, and the healthcare REIT has devised a plan to move beyond this significant headwind.\n",
            "MPT has found tenants to occupy 15 of the 23 hospitals previously owned by Steward Healthcare. These new tenants will only start paying rent next year, and even then, they won't pay the full amount until the fourth quarter of 2026.\n",
            "Still, this is a win for MPT: It grants the company more diversity, so it will be less likely to incur significant losses due to a single tenant defaulting on its rent. Further, these new occupants signed an average lease term of 18 years, granting MPT a predictable source of income for the next two decades.\n",
            "The company is moving in the right direction, but it's too early to celebrate. MPT remains a somewhat risky income stock, given its recent history. I'd advise dividend seekers to avoid this company for now.\n",
            "MPT wasn't the only high-profile dividend stock to cut its payouts in the past couple of years. Retail pharmacy giant Walgreens did the same. In January, Walgreens announced it was decreasing its dividend by 48%.\n",
            "It wasn't much of a surprise: The company had been dealing with slow revenue growth and more than occasional net losses for a few years. Walgreens' fourth quarter 2024 -- ending on Aug. 31 -- was no different. Its revenue increased by just 6% year over year to $37.5 billion.\n",
            "On the bottom, Walgreens' loss per share of $3.48 was far worse than the net loss per share of $0.21 reported in the year-ago period. Walgreens has mentioned the challenging U.S. retail environment as one of the factors responsible for its poor performances. Amazon (among others) is competing with the company, with its Amazon pharmacy unit launching in late 2020.\n",
            "Amazon, which already has a vast army of loyal Prime members who rely on it for everything from groceries to books and electronic purchases, offers free rapid delivery options for medicines to its members. For many patients, it's more convenient to bundle purchases through Amazon.\n",
            "Many others feel the same about Walgreens, but the added competition isn't helping the company.\n",

The company has also been expanding its footprints in the primary care market, something that could add some much-needed diversity in case its retail pharmacy segment remains under pressure from competitors.\n",

This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. FDS currently has a PEG ratio of 3.25.\n",
            "Another notable valuation metric for IKTSY is its P/B ratio of 5.44. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, FDS has a P/B of 9.76.\n",
            "These metrics, and several others, help IKTSY earn a Value grade of B, while FDS has been given a Value grade of D.\n",

            "As they say, 'You sell more umbrellas when it's raining.\" The same applies to backup power generators. The world is experiencing very unsettling weather events, often referred to as 100-year storms. The Atlantic 2024 hurricane season, lasting from June 1st to November 30th, has produced 17 tropical cyclones, with 11 of those storms turning into hurricanes.\n",
            "Hurricane Helene was the biggest hurricane to hit the country since 2005's Hurricane Katrina, generating 140 mph winds and knocking out power to 4.5 million customers in the Carolinas, Florida, Virginia, Georgia, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and Tennessee. Backup generators are a more economical and quicker solution for producing electricity outside of installing expensive solar energy systems or fixing the grid.\n",
            "The aging power grid infrastructure continues to shoulder massive strains in the United States as energy generation rose 9% YoY in 2024. Much of this has been driven by the growth and expansion of data centers powered by AI deployment and applications from hyperscalers like Microsoft Co. (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META). Electric vehicle (EV) usage will continue to tax the power grid. The U.S. grid was built in the mid-20th century. Due to wear and tear, extreme weather events, and insufficient upgrades, power outages are becoming more frequent for longer periods, especially during extreme weather situations like hurricanes, heat waves, and snow and ice storms.\n",
            "California estimates it will have to spend $30 billion to upgrade its power grid to meet its clean energy goals. Generac was selected to enter into negotiations by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to receive $50 million in a grant award under its Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership in California. The aim is to collaborate with the California Water Association to integrate clean energy utilization microgrids utilizing battery energy storage during times of grid stress.\n",
            "Generac CEO Aaron Jagdfeld stated, 'The vulnerability of our nation's electrical grid has never been more evident with the U.S. experiencing the highest level of power outage hours through the first nine months of the year since we began tracking outage data in 2010. In addition to more volatile weather, the rapid adoption of renewable, intermittent power generation sources and accelerating demand for electricity will likely lead to additional stresses on our aging grid.'\n",
            "Jagdfeld concluded, 'The elevated outage activity and growing grid-related supply-demand imbalances are expected to drive both continued near-term demand as well as long-term awareness of the growing need for backup power products.\"\n",
            "While Generac generates 83% of its revenue in the United States, the company is planning to continue expanding its international footprint. Generac is actively targeting Europe and Asia as demand for backup power demand is increasing due to their aging grid infrastructure. Generac's strategic acquisition of European generator maker Pramac was intended to grow its presence in Germany, Spain, France, Romania, China, and the United Kingdom.\n",

The company continues to establish partnerships with installers and distributors to expand its reach and provide local support to consumers. However, its Q3 2024 earnings saw its international sales fall 20% YoY to $166.7 million due to softness in telecom and weaker market conditions in Europe.\n",

Its Residential sales grew 27% YoY to $723 million. Its Commercial & Industrial (C&I) sales rose 15% to $328 million.

            "Suncor is relatively unknown in the United States, except to investors who focus on energy stocks. However, it is the second-largest energy company in Canada, where it develops petroleum basins nationwide. With a market capitalization of $51 billion, Suncor is less than half the size of ConocoPhillips and under 1/10th the size of Exxon Mobil. Still, Suncor's stock is up by nearly a quarter in the last year, far outpacing the growth of these two larger firms.\n",
            "The company had a strong third quarter, solidly beating analyst predictions with earnings of $1.08 per share and the latest in a series of quarterly earnings surprises. Despite the fact that earnings did decline slightly on a year-over-year basis, Suncor's announcement that its operational streamlining process has been a success more quickly than anticipated gave the company's stock a boost. Suncor intends to return all excess cash to shareholders following the achievement of its debt target.\n",
            "Six out of eight analysts Suncor have rated it a Buy, and the consensus price target of $56.40 is nearly 40% above current price levels. If Suncor can maintain its operations and remain disciplined about debt management, investors could reap rewards both in stock appreciation and dividends.\n",
            "Another Canadian company, Cenovus has a diverse set of both downstream and upstream operations that has helped it to stand out among smaller energy firms. Cenovus is in the final stages of completing a key pipeline connection between a processing facility at Christina Lake in western Canada and Narrows Lake, a nearby operation. When the project is completed—likely in mid-2025—it could add as much as 30,000 bbls/d in production capacity.\n",
            "Cenovus also has a number of new well pads that have either recently come online or are expected to become operational in the coming quarters. Together, these new projects should keep the company's production levels increasing. Cenovus has also been successful at limiting costs as it expands, which is especially crucial for a smaller energy firm.\n",
            "Analysts expect shares of Cenovus to nearly double to $30 a piece. Even still, the firm's total market value would remain just a fraction of the major companies mentioned above, making this a great example of an under-the-radar company worth watching in the energy sector.\n",
            "TotalEnergies is a French energy firm with operations that are broad in scope and geographic area. A key benefit to this breadth is the company's prospects for expanding both its traditional oil exploration and production as well as areas including renewables and liquefied natural gas.\n",
            "With a forward P/E ratio of 7.7 and a price-to-sales ratio of 0.7, TotalEnergies is likely undervalued in the market. Analyst views of the company's prospects support this assessment, as the firm has a price target of nearly $79, a 29.4% potential upside. TotalEnergies' shares are also down more than 8% in the last year, presenting a potential opportunity to buy before a turnaround begins.\n",
            "A major factor in the performance of oil and gas companies is the price of crude oil itself, which is typically highly variable. With Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, increasing turmoil in the Middle East, and other unknowns about the policies of the new U.S. administration all at play, it's particularly difficult to gauge how the price of oil may move. Investors should beware that a drop in oil prices could make any of these firms a much less attractive prospect.\n",

            "Article: Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares have surged nearly 40% over the past four trading sessions following Donald Trump's return to the White House. Despite Trump's historically skeptical stance on EVs, his growing connection with Elon Musk could mark a shift in policy. Musk's influence and possible role within the administration may set the stage for a more favorable environment for the EV giant.\n",
            "That's certainly the view of Bank of America analyst John Murphy, who noted, 'A Trump administration could ease regulations, supporting TSLA's growth trajectory. On that point, the Biden administration has launched several probes into TSLA's FSD system, and we see potential for less aggressive scrutiny under a Trump administration.'\n",
            "Additionally, Elon Musk has suggested a national framework for regulating self-driving cars, which the Trump administration has shown a willingness to consider. This could simplify the launch of Tesla's Robotaxi service planned for next year, which currently needs approval on a state-by-state basis.\n",
            "Trump has little time for climate change or environmental policies (which in a sense formed the foundation for Tesla's initial value proposition) and somewhat ironically, that could also prove fruitful for Tesla. He has signaled an intention to ease environmental regulations, which could prompt 'incumbent OEMs' to slow their EV expansion plans due to reduced regulatory pressure that currently drives the shift from ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles to EVs.\n",
            "'This could help TSLA maintain its hold on the domestic EV market, especially as it is planning to release new models with more affordable entry prices,' Murphy opined. Additionally, the Trump administration is expected to adopt a 'tougher stance' on China, meaning some of Tesla's competitors might not enter the US EV market.\n",
            "While other commentators have noted the latter point could backfire when considering the potential retort from Beijing to any tariffs, that's not a risk brought up by Murphy. The analyst does make the case, though, that if the Trump administration moves forward with proposals to limit or eliminate tax credits for EVs and subsidies for automakers producing cars and batteries in the US, it could result in an impact on Tesla's growth. 'However,' he goes on to add, 'we believe TSLA would be less impacted than competition so may benefit on a net basis.'\n",
            "To this end, Murphy rates Tesla shares a Buy, while lifting his price target from $265 to $350. However, with TSLA's current price hitting this level, Murphy may soon need to reconsider his target. (To watch Murphy's track record, click here)\n",

            "Article: Hydrogen power is often hailed as the ideal green alternative to fossil fuels since it can be produced using renewable energy like wind or solar to produce the electricity needed to split water into its component parts of hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen that is extracted is then used to power an engine and the only byproduct of the burned fuel is water. But being an ideal fuel hasn't been enough of an incentive for companies in this sector of the energy industry over the past decade, and many of the market's hydrogen stocks fizzled out.\n",
            "Industries have been slow to adopt hydrogen power because it currently costs more to produce hydrogen fuel than it does to extract and process oil or natural gas, and it was more cost-efficient to expand existing electrical grids than to build new hydrogen infrastructure. Inflation and elevated interest rates made hydrogen projects more expensive to fund and even less appealing.\n",
            "Image source: Getty Images.\n",
            "But as hydrogen technologies improve and the macroeconomic environment improves (including interest rate drops), the savings from using hydrogen could offset those initial costs. If that happens, many hydrogen industries could recover. Fortune Business Insights estimates the hydrogen fuel cell market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30% from 2024 to 2032, while Research Nester expects the hydrogen vehicle market to expand at a CAGR of 45% from 2025 to 2037.\n",
            "We should take those bullish estimates with a grain of salt, but two unloved stocks from those two industries -- Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG) and Nikola (NASDAQ: NKLA) -- could soar higher as those tailwinds kick in. Both of these stocks are volatile, but they have the potential to turn a modest $200 investment into a few thousand dollars over the next few years.\n",
            "Plug Power mainly provides hydrogen fuel cells and charging services for forklifts in warehouses and fulfillment centers. It's deployed over 69,000 fuel cell systems and 250 fueling stations so far, its top customers include Amazon and Walmart, and it's the world's largest single buyer of liquid hydrogen.\n",
            "Plug Power's revenue rose 40% in 2022 and 27% in 2023. Most of that growth was driven by two big acquisitions which expanded its cryogenic equipment unit and offset the slower growth of its core hydrogen fuel cell business -- which struggled as the macro headwinds curbed the market's appetite for expensive new hydrogen projects. Its net losses also widened throughout both years as it integrated those acquisitions.\n",
            "But from 2023 to 2026, analysts expect Plug's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 25% as it narrows its net losses. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) also recently granted it a new $1.66 billion loan to build up to six new green hydrogen energy production facilities.\n",
            "With an enterprise value of $2.67 billion, Plug's stock looks undervalued at 2.3 times next year's sales. It's still a highly speculative stock, but it could rally again as more companies upgrade their logistics networks with its hydrogen charging systems. Its insiders also bought nearly five times as many shares as they sold over the past 12 months, and Norway's Norges Bank recently increased its stake in the company to nearly 8%.\n",
            "Nikola produces electric semi-trucks. It initially sold battery-powered electric trucks (BEVs), but it started delivering its first hydrogen fuel-cell electric trucks (FCEVs) this year. It had a rocky start after its public debut in 2020: it broadly missed its original delivery targets, its founder Trevor Milton was convicted of securities and wire fraud in 2022, and a series of battery fires in 2023 forced it to recall all of its BEVs. It's also unprofitable, it nearly quadrupled its share count over the past three years to raise more cash, and it faces stiff competition from Daimler Truck and Tesla in the nascent electric semi-truck market.\n",
            "But amid all of those challenges, a few green shoots are appearing. Its BEV sales are still suspended as it resolves its battery issues, but it delivered 203 FCEVs in the first nine months of 2024. It expects to deliver 300-350 FCEVs for the full year, and analysts expect its revenue to more than triple to $112 million. For 2025, they expect Nikola's revenue to nearly triple to $328 million as it ramps up its FCEV shipments and restarts its BEV business. Nikola also aims to build a network of 60 hydrogen charging stations across the U.S. with its partner Voltera by 2026.\n",
            "With an enterprise value of $338 million, Nikola's stock looks dirt cheap at roughly 1 time next year's sales. Its insiders also bought 15 times as many shares as they sold over the past 12 months -- so it might be a tempting longshot play on the hydrogen vehicle market.\n",

            "Article: CVS Health (CVS) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n",
            "Shares of this drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager have returned -16.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. The Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, to which CVS Health belongs, has lost 17.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n",
            "While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n",
            "Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n",
            "We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n",
            "For the current quarter, CVS Health is expected to post earnings of $1.35 per share, indicating a change of -36.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -18.2% over the last 30 days.\n",
            "The consensus earnings estimate of $5.44 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -37.8%. This estimate has changed -16.5% over the last 30 days.\n",
            "For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.75 indicates a change of +24% from what CVS Health is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -7.2%.\n",
            "With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for CVS Health.\n",
            "The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n",
            "While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n",
            "For CVS Health, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $97.29 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $371.17 billion and $387.61 billion estimates indicate +3.7% and +4.4% changes, respectively.\n",
            "CVS Health reported revenues of $95.43 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.3%. EPS of $1.09 for the same period compares with $2.21 a year ago.\n",
            "Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $92.87 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.75%. The EPS surprise was +1.87%.\n",

            "Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n",
            "While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n",

For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n",
            "While the historical EPS growth rate for Fortinet is 42%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 33.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 31.2%.\n",
            "While cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\n",
            "Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Fortinet is 34.6%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -12.9%.\n",
            "While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 34.5% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 15.2%.\n",
            "Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n",
            "There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Fortinet. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 8.3% over the past month.\n",

The ability for AI-driven software and systems to become more proficient at their assigned tasks, as well as learn new skills over time without the aid of human intervention, gives this technology seemingly limitless long-term potential.\n",
            "In Sizing the Prize, the analysts at PwC estimated AI would increase worldwide gross domestic product (GDP) 26% ($15.7 trillion) by the turn of the decade. A lift of this magnitude means companies up and down the AI landscape can be winners.\n",

In less than two years, Nvidia has grown from a $360 billion business that was somewhat important within the tech sector to Wall Street's most-valuable publicly traded company ($3.64 trillion market cap).\n",
            "Given the critical role Nvidia is playing in the AI revolution, Wall Street and investors are laser-focused on Nov. 20, which is when the company will lift its proverbial hood and unveil its operating results for the quarter ending on Oct. 27.\n",
            "While the optimism surrounding Nvidia is thick enough to cut with a knife, I can offer a half-dozen reasons Nvidia stock will hit a brick wall on Nov. 20.\n",
            "Before digging into the details of why Nvidia's stock can struggle following the release of its fiscal third-quarter results, let me provide some background that explains why Nvidia has added $3.3 trillion in market value in under two years.\n",
            "The heart of Nvidia's growth is its hardware. Orders for the company's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU), commonly referred to as the \"Hopper,\" and the successor Blackwell GPU architecture, are backlogged. Businesses are eager to gain first-mover advantages, and Nvidia's AI-GPUs offer superior computing capabilities.\n",
            "In addition to strong demand, Nvidia is commanding stratospheric pricing power for its hardware. Whereas competing AI-GPUs are being priced in the $10,000 to $15,000 range, the Hopper has been consistently commanding a price point of $30,000 to $40,000 per chip. Businesses willingly paying a premium for Nvidia's solutions pushed its gross margin to as high as 78%.\n",
            "I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention the key role Nvidia's CUDA software platform has played in driving sales growth. CUDA is the toolkit developers use to build large language models and maximize the computing potential of their GPUs. In other words, CUDA is the lure that's keeping Nvidia's customers within its umbrella of products and services.\n",
            "With truly staggering sales growth -- $27 billion in fiscal 2023 to an estimated $180 billion in fiscal 2026 -- it's not surprising to see investors piling in.\n",
            "Yet there's a half-dozen reasons to believe the perfect storm is brewing for Nvidia, which needs nothing short of flawless execution to sustain its nearly parabolic move higher.\n",
            "Image source: Getty Images.\n",
            "When Nvidia delivers its fiscal Q3 operating results in four days, there's a good chance it'll top consensus revenue and profit forecasts. Over the last seven quarters, Nvidia has handily outpaced earnings-per-share (EPS) expectations. But simply surpassing what was expected of the company in its October quarter is unlikely to be enough to support additional upside for a variety of reasons.\n",
            "To start with, external competition has officially arrived. After Nvidia secured an estimated 98% of GPU shipments to data centers in 2022 and 2023, based on a study by TechInsights, it'll likely cede some of this market share to Advanced Micro Devices this year. AMD is quickly ramping up production of its MI300X AI-GPU, and recently introduced the MI325X, which should go into production before the end of the year. With Nvidia's GPUs backlogged and businesses eager to gain first-mover advantages, it wouldn't be surprising to see companies scoop up AMD's AI hardware instead.\n",
            "However, a bigger threat to Nvidia might just be internal competition. Many of its top customers by net sales, including Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet, are internally developing AI chips for use in their data centers. The cost to develop/produce these internal chips, coupled with their ease of access, could make them more favorable than Nvidia's hardware in future quarters.\n",
            "Nvidia's gross margin expansion will likely prove unsustainable as GPU scarcity diminishes. NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts.\n",
            "To add to this second point, AI-GPU scarcity has played a critical role in lifting Nvidia's pricing power. As more chips become available and scarcity wanes, Nvidia's pricing power and gross margin will be negatively impacted.\n",
            "The third issue to consider is that Nvidia is still constrained by its supply chain. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which produces chips for Nvidia, is aiming to boost its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) monthly production capacity to 80,000 wafers. CoWoS is necessary for the packaging of high-bandwidth memory in AI-accelerated data centers. Being at the mercy of its suppliers means Nvidia isn't able to meet all of its orders and could cause it to lose valuable data center real estate to external and internal competitors.\n",
            "Fourth, export regulations offer little reason to cheer. In 2022, U.S. regulators clamped down on Nvidia's ability to export its AI-GPUs to China, the world's No. 2 economy by GDP. The following year, Nvidia's toned-down AI chips, the A800 and H800, which were designed specifically for China, were also added to the export restriction list. With President-Elect Donald Trump promising to get tough on trade with China, Nvidia's prospects of generating big bucks from exports of AI hardware to China are quickly dimming.\n",
            "Insider selling has picked up in 2024. NVDA Shares Sold By Insiders data by YCharts.\n",
            "Insider trading activity provides the fifth puzzle piece of the perfect storm for Nov. 20. Over the last 47 months, no executive or director has purchased a single share of Nvidia stock on the open market. While there are plenty of reasons to sell stock, not all of which are nefarious, the only reason to buy shares of a company is if you think they're headed higher. The actions of Nvidia's executives and directors make it clear that Nvidia stock isn't viewed as a good value.\n",
            "The sixth and final reason I'll be looking for Nvidia stock to hit a brick wall on Nov. 20 is history. Over the past three decades, investors have consistently overestimated how quickly a new technology or innovation will gain utility and/or adoption. This leads to lofty growth expectations that eventually (key word!) come up short.\n",
            "Despite ample demand for the Hopper and Blackwell, what's sorely lacking from Nvidia's customers are well-defined plans to monetize their AI investments. In other words, businesses are buying, but there's no clear use case. All technologies need time to mature, and artificial intelligence is unlikely to be the exception to the unwritten rule. In my view, this puts Nvidia stock in a precarious position come Nov. 20.\n",

            "Shares of this financial firm appear to have outperformed the broader market over the past year, delivering gains of roughly 60%, compared to the S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) 30.5% annual return. In 2024, HBAN stock is up nearly 38.4%, surpassing the broader SPX's return of 23% on a YTD basis.\n",
            "Narrowing the focus, the financial stock has also outshined the First Trust Financials AlphaDEX Fund's (FXO) 44.6% return over the past 52 weeks and has posted gains in 2024 that are almost in line with ETF's 30.3% YTD growth.\n",
            "The company revealed its Q3 earnings report on Oct. 17, which crushed Wall Street's top and bottom-line estimates, yet these results failed to trigger excitement among investors, evident from its share remaining nearly flat post-announcement.\n",
            "However, more recently, on Nov. 6, Huntington shares took more than 12% along with a few other financial heavyweights, fueled by a wave of optimism following Donald Trump's election and the potential for a Republican-led Congress. The rally reflected heightened enthusiasm for potential financial deregulation, with investors pouring into higher-risk financial plays amid hopes of a more lenient regulatory environment.\n",
            "For the current fiscal year, ending in December, analysts expect HBAN's EPS to decline 11% to $1.21. Nevertheless, the company's earnings surprise history is quite impressive. It beat the consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters.\n",
            "Among the 19 analysts covering HBAN stock, the consensus view is a 'Moderate Buy.' That's based on 10 'Strong Buy' ratings, one 'Moderate Buy,' seven 'Holds,' and one 'Strong Sell' rating.\n",
            "The mood on Wall Street is slightly less bullish compared to two months ago when 11 analysts suggested a 'Strong Buy.'\n",
            "On Nov. 11, RBC Capital adjusted the company's price target to $20 from $17, which is also HBAN's Street-high target, and also maintained an 'outperform' rating on the stock. This newly raised target suggests an upside potential of around 14.2% from current levels. On the other hand, the mean price target of $17.46 represents a marginal potential upside to HBAN's current price levels.\n",

Earnings and revenues surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.8% and 7.2%. The third-quarter performance was driven by strong production volumes from the Delaware Basin, offset marginally by the drop in realized prices of the commodities.DVN has been reporting strong earnings results, courtesy of solid financial and operational performance from its multi-basin assets.

Actual production volume exceeded the guided range of 670,000-690,000 Boe/d. Strong performance from the Delaware Basin and Powder River Basin boosted year-over-year production volumes.Natural gas liquids production increased 16.9% year over year to 194,000 barrels per day (Bbl/d). Oil production amounted to 335,000 Bbl/d, up 4.4% on a year-over-year basis, attributed to a strong contribution from the Delaware Basin.Devon repurchased shares worth $295 million in the third quarter from its $3 billion share-repurchase program. Since the inception of the buyback program in late 2021, the company has repurchased shares worth $3 billion.Devon declared its fixed quarterly cash dividend of 22 cents per share, payable on Dec. 30, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec. 13, 2024. With the recent pullback in commodity prices and equities, as well as the additional leverage taken on by the company, Devon's management has decided not to declare a variable dividend in the current quarter. Devon's capital allocation will now focus on strengthening the balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders through the fixed dividend and share buybacks.\n",

Devon also has a diverse commodity mix, with a balanced exposure to oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquid production volumes.Fourth-quarter production is expected in the range of 811,000-830,000 Boe per day and capital spending is estimated in the band of $915-$985 million. The fourth-quarter production guidance indicates a 13% increase sequentially.The company continues to expand its operation in high-quality basins through acquisitions. Devon acquired the Williston Basin business of Grayson Mill Energy. This fourth-quarter volume growth will be driven by an estimated 110,000 Boe/d of incremental production from the company's Williston Basin acquisition.Devon possesses assets that can deliver sustainable production for many years into the future and provide reliable and affordable energy to its customers. The assets currently owned by the company can sustain the production levels for more than 10 years. The ongoing exploration activities continue to replenish production volumes and add new reserves.\n",
            "Devon continues to manage costs to boost margins. The company has been reducing its costs by selling higher-cost assets and bringing new lower-cost production assets online. It is also working to reduce its drilling and completion costs and is better aligning personnel with the go-forward business.\n",
            "Devon's return on equity (ROE) has outperformed the industry average in the trailing 12 months. ROE of DVN was 24.73% compared with the industry average of 15.7%.

            "Zacks Premium also includes the Zacks Style Scores.\n",
            "The Zacks Style Scores is a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on three popular investing types, and were developed as complementary indicators for the Zacks Rank. This combination helps investors choose securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\n",
            "Each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.\n",
            "The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\n",
            "Value Score\n",
            "For value investors, it's all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.\n",
            "Growth Score\n",
            "Growth investors, on the other hand, are more concerned with a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score examines things like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will experience sustainable growth over time.\n",
            "Momentum Score\n",
            "Momentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook, and these investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.\n",
            "VGM Score\n",
            "What if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.\n",
            "The Zacks Rank, which is a proprietary stock-rating model, employs earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to make building a winning portfolio easier.\n",
            "#1 (Strong Buy) stocks have produced an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, which is more than double the S&P 500's performance over the same time frame. However, the Zacks Rank examines a ton of stocks, and there can be more than 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, and another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\n",
            "This totals more than 800 top-rated stocks, and it can be overwhelming to try and pick the best stocks for you and your portfolio.\n",
            "That's where the Style Scores come in.\n",
            "To have the best chance of big returns, you'll want to always consider stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B, which will give you the highest probability of success. If you're looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, it's important they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.\n",
            "Since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy.\n",
            "A stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, for instance, even one with Scores of A and B, will still have a declining earnings forecast, and a greater chance its share price will fall too.\n",

            "Here are three of the companies he said investors should pay close attention to.\n",
            "'I believe they are the leader in virtual reality (VR),' said Ebensperger. 'VR devices are likely to be the interface that will replace the smartphone.\n",
            "'Meta's fundamentals are stellar. It already has a full-blown ecosystem of social, software and cloud computing to support its VR hardware.'\n",
            "After a tough stretch toward the end of 2021 and throughout most of 2022, Meta Platforms has been a strong performer since.\n",
            "With revenue growth expected to be 20.6% in 2025 and earnings per share (EPS) growth expected to be roughly 48%, many analysts believe there is significant room for the stock to continue running higher over the long term.\n",
            "Read Next: I'm a Self-Made Millionaire — 5 Stocks You Shouldn't Sell\n",
            "'In a similar vein, there is HPQ. HP has also successfully rolled out headsets, focusing at this stage on the enterprise and professional sectors,' said Ebensperger.\n",
            "'When looking at the Ziggma stock score, one can see that the company's prospects are also very solid. Revenue growth is not exactly mind-blowing, but that could change quickly if VR headsets were to take off.'\n",
            "The last five years have been fairly choppy in terms of HPs stock price. However, the trend line is pointed up. Plus, with the launch of VR headsets, a new line of computers that integrate artificial intelligence (AI) and an attractive 3% dividend, this stock could be ready to take off to new highs.\n",
            "'Since I was looking at the VR space, an interesting stock is IMMR (Immersion Corp),' said Ebensperger. 'It's a small cap, with the speculative nature that comes with it. But revenue estimates are through the roof (only by two analysts).\n",
            "'IMMR is a leader in haptic technology, which is a high-growth tech space.'\n",
            "Immersion Corp has had a rough time since the middle of the summer, but the stock price doesn't exactly tell the entire story. While this small cap stock doesnt have a huge following from analysts, those that do cover the company feel that this could be the perfect time to buy the dip and hold for long-term growth.\n",
            "It's revenue over the trailing 12 months has been $163.1 million, which is a significant increase over the $33.9 million in revenue generated in 2023. However, what's impressive is the expected revenue growth for 2025.\n",
            "It's expected that revenue could grow to $682 million. What's even more impressive is that the stock price is cheap. It currently trades at a P/E of 3.9x while also offering a 2.48% dividend yield.\n",
            "While it's difficult to really know which companies could become the next Apple, we can use the data we have to make some pretty good predictions.\n",
            "Apple's success has been built based on a strong product line and great management. For another company to replicate the same success, it's going to take a lot of the same characteristics.\n",

            "Article: After a 10% decline since the beginning of this year, at the current price of around $68 per share, we believe Restaurant Brands International Inc. stock (NYSE: QSR), one of the largest fast-food restaurant chains in the world, including Burger King, Tim Hortons, Popeyes, and, since late 2021, also Firehouse Subs – could see modest gains in the near term. QSR stock has declined from around $78 to $68 year-t0-date, underperforming the broader indices, with the S&P growing about 20% over the same period. In comparison, QSR's peer Starbucks' (NASDAQ: SBUX) stock increased 3% year-to-date to $97.\n",
            "QSR's stock decline can be attributed to investors' concern about rising costs and their effects on the company's bottom line. The company's stock has been modestly lower since its Q3 report – as increased sales and profits in Q3 did not improve as much as the market anticipated. QSR's Q3 revenues grew 25% y-o-y to $2.3 billion, driven by an increase in system-wide sales primarily in the International and Tim Hortons segment. The company's consolidated comparable sales came in at 0.3% compared to 7% a year ago. Among the five reporting segments, the company saw a notable decline across all segments – a negative 0.7% for Burger King, a negative 4.0% for Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Tim Hortons comp sales fell to 2.3% from 7.6% previously, and Firehouse Subs same-store sales fell to negative 4.8%. On the bottom line, the company's earnings were flat y-o-y at 79 cents in the third quarter (while adjusted profits increased 4.6% to $0.93).\n",
            "QSR is one of a handful of stocks that have increased their value in each of the last 3 years, but that still wasn't enough for it to consistently beat the market Returns for the stock were 3% in 2021, 11% in 2022, and 25% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period.\n",
            "Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could QSR face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months – or will it see a strong jump?\n",
            "Restaurant Brands stock trades at a lower price-to-earnings ratio of ~17x – compared to a P/E ratio of 25x for Yum! Brands (NYSE: YUM), 26x for McDonald's (NYSE: MCD), and 29x for Starbucks. That said, QSR's current valuation is also lower than its own five-year average of 24.5x. We forecast QSR's Revenues to be $8.2 billion for the fiscal year 2024, up almost 17% year over year. Looking at the bottom line, we now forecast EPS to come in at $4.01. Given the changes to our revenues and earnings forecast, we have revised our QSR's Valuation to around $75 per share, based on $4.01 expected EPS and an 18.7x P/E multiple for the fiscal year 2024—which is 10% higher than the current market price.\n",
            "The company has solid mid-to-long-term growth prospects. Tim Horton's, Popeyes, and Firehouse Subs are far less penetrated internationally than McDonald's or Burger King. That means more room to open new restaurants and a longer runway for revenue growth. The revenue stream of QSR is directly influenced by the system sales it generates across its brands, which can be increased by growing restaurant sales or by adding as many restaurants as possible. It should be noted that the company's Q3 net restaurant growth expanded by 3.8% compared to the previous year (contributing to a total count of 31,525 restaurants globally) – despite cost inflation. [System-wide sales are different from revenues in that they refer to sales for all franchise restaurants, while revenues include supply chain sales, as well as royalty, property, and advertising revenues from the franchises.] It should be noted that QSR's latest third-quarter results include the incorporation of Carrolls Restaurant Group and Popeyes China under a new reporting segment, Restaurant Holdings (RH).\n",
            "QSR released its five-year outlook earlier this year. The company expects a $60 billion system-wide sales figure in 2028. This represents a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR ) of ~7% from 2023. The company also expects the adjusted operating profit to rise to $2 billion by 2028, a CAGR of 7.8% from 2023. All in all, the company's outlook seems optimistic for the next five years. This reflects that even if there's a slowdown in the next year or two, the stock can still perform well.\n",

            "Despite reporting weaker-than-expected Q3 adjusted EPS of $0.89 and revenue of $2.8 billion, Sempra's shares climbed 7.3% on Nov. 6 due to positive developments that offset weak Q3 earnings. The company announced a $3 billion equity offering, signaling a commitment to growth without excessive debt in a high-interest environment. Its Texas utility, Oncor, revealed a planned increase of 40%-50% to its five-year capital plan to address the rapid growth in energy demand in Texas, particularly from AI and data center sectors, which investors saw as a strategic growth opportunity. Additionally, Sempra reaffirmed both its long-term EPS growth target of 6%-8% and its 2024 EPS guidance of $4.60–$4.90, along with confirming that its Energia Costa Azul LNG project in Mexico remains on schedule for a 2026 launch, all of which reassured investors about its future revenue streams.\n",

While there's always a chance something disappointing could be revealed, Nvidia currently appears to be in too strong a position to meaningfully change its trajectory over the long term. Here are three reasons why Nvidia's stock is a buy today.\n",
            "We'll learn more about Blackwell's release, but all signs point to a successful rollout of Nvidia's newest iteration chips. There was a hiccup earlier this year when reports of fabrication issues spooked investors. It's now clear that Nvidia handled the issue swiftly, and what could have been a significant delay was only a month or two. Blackwell is set to be delivered to customers shortly.\n",
            "The chips are a significant upgrade to the already uber-powerful Hopper chips, which still appear to be selling extremely well despite the imminent release of their successors. Elon Musk and his xAI team bought 100,000 Hopper chips just a few months ago and are in the process of purchasing another 50,000.\n",
            "It's a great position to be in when the demand for current and future iterations is at a fever pitch. It's been reported that Nvidia is sold out of Blackwell for at least 12 months following its release.\n",
            "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang described the demand as \"insane.\" The company is partnering with Foxconn in order to meet that demand, opening a new Blackwell-specific fabrication plant in Mexico.\n",
            "Taking a look at recent big-tech earnings calls from Nvidia's top customers, it's clear the money is still flowing. Tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet are spending billions building data centers that can handle the demands of AI. The capital expenditure (capex) of these companies rose sharply over the last year, with much of it flowing into Nvidia's coffers. The trend will likely continue.\n",
            "Meta aims to significantly boost its 2025 capital expenditure, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasizing the potential for a substantial return on investment (ROI) from AI advancements and even suggesting that capex needs to grow further. Alphabet spent $13 billion last quarter building data centers and expects the same in Q4, putting it on track to top $50 billion in capex for the year.\n",
            "Free cash flow (FCF) is a critical measure of a company's financial health, and Nvidia has a lot of it. Look at the explosion in FCF over the last few years compared to its rival AMD.\n",
            "Nvidia Free Cash Flow data by YCharts.\n",
            "That is a major divergence. FCF can be used for all sorts of things that either boost a company's ability to do business or enrich its shareholders, often both. It gives Nvidia immense resources to respond quickly and effectively to the market and critically defend its market dominance. As AMD and others try to keep pace, Nvidia can deploy this capital to outspend its competition significantly on, say, more R&D or poaching talent.\n",
            "At the same time, FCF can be used to repurchase shares, and that's exactly what Nvidia has been doing. Over the course of the first half of the year, it repurchased $15.1 billion in stock, and last quarter, announced the board had approved $50 billion in additional stock buybacks.\n",

            "Article: Warren Buffett is considered one of the greatest investors of all time. So when he talks, Wall Street listens.\n",
            "One point he has consistently hammered home throughout his illustrious career is the importance of buying shares of companies, intending to hold on to them for a long time, preferably forever. Buffett has generally followed his own advice. His portfolio features some excellent buy-and-hold options.\n",
            "One of the best is Visa (NYSE: V). The financial services giant ticks many of the boxes Warren Buffett looks for in a company. Let's consider why Visa is an outstanding stock to own for the long term.\n",
            "One of Buffett's rules is to invest in businesses you understand. It's a simple but important guideline. Unless you have a good command of a company's operations, you won't know what's likely to drive the performance of its stock, its risk factors, etc.\n",
            "The good news about Visa is that its business is fairly straightforward. It provides a payment network that connects merchants with the banks that issue credit cards, allowing transactions to run smoothly between the two.\n",
            "Visa's network supports a wide range of transactions, from credit cards to mobile payments, and the company collects a fee for each transaction. There is more to Visa. There are also critical nuances and caveats. However, the basic overview of the company's business is within anyone's grasp. And some good research can fill the remaining gaps.\n",
            "Buffett also seeks to invest in corporations with strong competitive advantages, or moats. Since business success will attract competitors, only those companies that have found ways to perform well despite the competition can deliver above-average returns over the long run.\n",
            "Moats can come in many forms. Visa's stems from the network effect, or the fact that the value of its platform increases with use. Businesses aren't obligated to accept cards that bear Visa's logo as forms of payment. However, since billions of them are in circulation, that would amount to turning down many potential customers.\n",
            "That's a powerful incentive for companies to get on board, and the more that join Visa's ecosystem, the more attractive it also is to consumers. The network effect in this niche is so powerful that it is basically a duopoly Visa shares with Mastercard. Further, Visa has generally kept pace with technological advances in its field.\n",
            "It's hard to see the company losing its leading position anytime soon, a significant reason why it is an excellent buy-and-hold candidate.\n",
            "Visa's strong business has generally produced excellent financial results. Revenue, net income, and free cash flow have been on an upward path over the past decade.\n",
            "V Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts\n",
            "Solid financials allow businesses to reward shareholders with growing payouts if they so choose. Buffett is a fan of dividends. Reinvesting the payouts while letting the magic of compounding do its thing over the long run is an incredibly powerful strategy, and one the Oracle of Omaha loves.\n",
            "Visa can provide exactly that. The company's dividends have increased by almost 392% in the past decade, yet its payout ratio remains a modest 21.36%. Some might even argue that Visa could have afforded to raise its dividends far more than it did, given its ultra-conservative payout ratio.\n",
            "Regardless, the financial services giant has room for more dividend hikes. It's hard to see the company resorting to payout cuts in the foreseeable future. Visa's strong dividend program is another reason it looks like an excellent forever stock.\n",
            "We didn't touch on every aspect of Visa's business, including the fact that there is plenty of room left for the company to displace cash and check transactions with digital ones, or its juicy margins. However, these three major points already make a strong case for the company.\n",
            "It's no wonder that Visa has been a regular in Buffett's portfolio for years. The company is well-positioned to provide outsized returns to investors who buy the stock today and stay put.\n",

            "Article: Special dividends are an added potential benefit for shareholders in certain companies. These payments are separate from a stock's regular dividend, which is usually paid on a quarterly basis. Special dividends happen irregularly and tend to be much larger than regular dividends. Due to this, they can provide a large temporary boost to the dividend yield investors earn from a stock. These payments often occur when a company's performance is particularly strong.\n",
            "By their nature, no one exactly knows when a company will decide to reward its investors with a special dividend. However, there are stocks that have shown patterns of paying special dividends. This provides data to understand which companies may be more likely to pay special dividends in the future. Below are three well-known stocks that have histories of paying special dividends.\n",
            "Costco (NASDAQ: COST), the membership-based consumer staples stock not only pays a regular dividend, but also special dividends. Currently, the company's regular dividend payment is $1.16 per share. With the company's share price over $900, the stock has a dividend yield of only around 0.5% annually. However, the company's massive special dividends have sometimes bumped this number up considerably. The company paid a special dividend in 2015, 2017, 2020, and at the beginning of 2024. Each time, the payment grew significantly. It started at $5 in 2015, went up to $7, then $10, and most recently, a whopping $15.\n",
            "When accounting for the firm's 2024 special dividend, its dividend yield jumps up to 2.1%. The yield reached nearly 6% in 2017, and edged over 4% in early 2021 due to the 2020 special dividend. Still, the company's dividend yield has been dropping consistently over time. However, that is largely due to the fact that the shares are up nearly 500% since the beginning of 2017. The company's regular and special dividend payments have both risen substantially as well, but just not enough to keep up with the stock that has risen nearly three times more than the S&P 500 since 2017. This is what caused the yield to fall.\n",
            "ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) is another big-name U.S. firm that has shown a willingness to pay shareholders back with special dividends. It has performed this three times in 2024, using a variable return of cash (VROC). This is a type of special dividend that usually is smaller but more frequent. They can occur when a company meets short-term performance goals. It made these VROC payments along with its dividend payments nearly every quarter from 2022 to 2024.\n",
            "As of the company's latest earnings report, it has decided to fully incorporate the VROC into its regular dividend. In Q2, the regular dividend was $0.50 per share, while the VROC was $0.28. In Q3, the regular dividend was simply the combination of the two at $0.78. This means the company expects to have more consistency in its ability to provide a higher regular dividend.\n",
            "Although the VROC is not part of the company's future, its use does signal that the firm may be willing to provide a larger, less frequent special dividend going forward. The company's outsized $1.40 VROC in Aug. 2022, which was over three times larger than the regular dividend that quarter, provides some evidence of this. The company also said it is looking to grow its dividend at a faster rate than 75% of S&P 500 companies.\n",
            "Ford (NYSE: F) has returned to paying investors a strong dividend. Based on the company's $0.15 regular dividend paid last quarter, its dividend yield is 5.3%. When incorporating the $0.18 special dividend paid in March, the figure jumps to nearly 7%. Ford also made a much larger $0.65 special dividend payment in March 2023. It also paid a special dividend each year from 2016 to 2018.\n",
            "Ford's dividend yield sits way above the 1.2% figure provided by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA: SPY) over the last twelve months. It is also way above that of all other U.S. automakers. Unfortunately, Ford has still provided a total return of -30% over the past three years, which is a dreadful showing. It is interesting to note that European car companies take the cake when it comes to dividend yield; some have the figure in double digits.\n",

            "You want to make sure you're buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success, and to do that, you'll need to pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you like a stock that only as a #3 (Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible.\n",

            "The initiative is centered around Fibertime's flagship product, offering uncapped, unthrottled Internet for just R5 a day, an essential service for millions across the region. As part of the agreement, the company will deploy Nokia's state-of-the-art Lightspan FX series of high-capacity access nodes, engineered to meet the demands of large-scale fiber deployments that deliver superior performance and scalability. With built-in Software-Defined Networking programmability, the solution ensures seamless Gigabit experiences for residential, mobile and business users. Fibertime also aims to deploy 500,000 Nokia Wi-Fi 6-enabled ONTs, prioritizing homes in areas with limited Internet access, over the next three years. This large-scale deployment will be powered by Nokia's ONT Easystart, an automated solution designed to streamline the ONT activation process, ensuring faster and more efficient deployments. The fiber deployment will initially target key urban centers such as Cape Town, Johannesburg, Gqeberha, Mangaung and Stellenbosch, expanding gradually into more regions.In addition to the fiber rollout, the partnership will also witness upgrades to the network, supported by Nokia's Altiplano platform. This platform supports 10G XGS-PON technology and offers a complete suite of network management and automation functions to help streamline network management, improve scalability and ensure the long-term reliability of its infrastructure.\n",
            "With the emergence of the smartphone market and subsequent usage of mobile broadband, user demand for coverage speed and quality has increased in recent times. Further, to maintain superior performance as traffic increases, there is also a continuous need for network tuning and optimization. Nokia's expertise in mission-critical networks is well-established, with deployments across more than 2,600 leading enterprise customers in the transportation, energy, manufacturing, webscale and public sector segments worldwide.This partnership between Nokia and Fibertime is a major step in addressing South Africa's digital gap. With millions of homes still without access to affordable, high-quality broadband, the market opportunity is significant. Nokia's fiber solution, which includes both OLTs and ONTs, will help to create a semi-mobile network that can serve entire communities, providing broadband access beyond just homes and businesses. This approach will help bridge the digital divide and provide individuals with the tools to access education, healthcare and employment opportunities more easily.

            "Article: Arlington, Texas-based D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI) engages in acquiring and developing land and constructing and selling residential homes. With a market cap of $52.7 billion, the company operates in the East, North, Southeast, South Central, Southwest, and Northwest regions of the United States.\n",
            "The Housing giant has lagged behind the broader market over the past year. DHI stock has gained 6.5% on a YTD basis and 31.9% over the past 52-week period, compared to the S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) 25.5% gains in 2024 and 35.5% returns over the past year.\n",
            "Narrowing the focus, DHI has also underperformed the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF's (XHB) 21.4% gains in 2024 and 49.9% returns over the past year.\n",
            "Shares of D.R. Horton plummeted 7.2% after the release of its Q4 earnings on Oct. 29. Due to the underperformance of its Homebuilding and Rental Property segments, the company's overall revenues declined 4.8% year-over-year to $10 billion. The high mortgage rates and buyers' hesitation have hurt D.R. Horton's topline growth. Despite a drop in mortgage rates from its peak, the rates have remained high and are expected to decline further in 2025, delaying customers' purchase decisions in the current quarters.\n",
            "D.R. Horton's profitability has also taken a sharp hit with its net income to shareholders declining around 15% compared to the year-ago quarter to $1.3 billion as it observed an increase in SG&A and other expenses. Moreover, its EPS of $3.92 missed analysts' estimates by a notable 6.7%, unsettling investors' confidence.\n",
            "For the current fiscal, ending in September 2025, analysts expect DHI to report a 4% year-over-year growth in EPS to $14.92. The company's earnings surprise history is mixed. It surpassed analysts' bottom-line estimates in two of the past four quarters while missing on two other occasions.\n",
            "DHI stock has a consensus 'Moderate Buy' rating overall. Out of the 19 analysts covering the stock, 10 recommend 'Strong Buy,' one advises 'Moderate Buy,' seven suggest 'Hold,' and one advocates a 'Strong Sell' rating.\n",
            "On Oct. 31, BTIG lowered its price target on D.R. Horton to $186, maintaining a 'Buy' rating following the company's Q4 earnings miss. The firm attributes the shortfall to lower delivery volume, pricing pressure, reduced margins, and softer financial services income, as customers delay purchases amid high interest rates and upcoming elections.\n",
            "DHI's mean price target of $191.78 represents a premium of 18.5% to current price levels. The Street-high target of $220 suggests a potential upside of 35.9%.\n",

            "Article: What is Warren Buffett's favorite stock? Other than the company he chairs, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) may well be at the top of that list. The iPhone maker has been one of Buffett's largest holdings for years, even as he has decreased his stake in the tech company over the past 12 months.\n",
            "Regardless, Apple remains a top stock to buy, and thanks to ongoing development and progress, the company could deliver market-beating returns through the end of the decade. Let's find out why.\n",
            "The latest iteration of Apple's famous device, the iPhone 16, came out earlier this year. The iPhone no longer generates the buzz it once did, but the company is counting on a suite of artificial intelligence (AI) features the iPhone 16 comes with to raise consumers' interest.\n",
            "None of Apple's AI features are particularly new. They include generative AI-assisted writing, editing, and summarization tools; ChatGPT integrated with Siri; the ability to create images; and more, all of which many other companies offer in some capacity.\n",
            "However, few companies have the kind of ecosystem and consumer loyalty that Apple has. Its integration of nifty AI tools into its most popular device (and others) at a time when people are generally excited about what the technology can do could lead to a robust renewal cycle, resulting in solid revenue growth.\n",
            "Apple is just getting started, too. During the company's fourth-quarterearnings conference call CEO Tim Cook said: \"This is just the beginning of what we believe generative AI can do, and I couldn't be more excited for what's to come.\"\n",
            "Some investors and analysts were unhappy with Apple because they thought it was trailing its tech industry peers in using AI. Apple, though, does not necessarily seek to be first to market. The iPhone was not the first portable phone or even smartphone, nor were its AirPods the first headphones. They were just significant improvements over the then-available options.\n",
            "While it's not known what Apple will do next in AI, but clearly, the company has big plans in that department. It could provide a significant tailwind for Apple in the coming years, especially as it has plenty of money to invest.\n",
            "AAPL Free Cash Flow data by YCharts\n",
            "Apple ended its latest period, the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2024, with $108.81 billion in free cash flow, a slight increase compared to the year-ago period.\n",
            "In Apple's fourth quarter (ended Sept. 28), the company reported revenue of $94.9 billion, an increase of 6% year over year. Apple's services segment continues to grow faster than the rest of the business, with services sales coming in at about $25 billion, 12% higher than the year-ago period. According to management, Apple's number of active devices reached a new all-time high, although it did not give an exact number. But it's believed to be well over 2 billion.\n",
            "Apple's massive ecosystem is a major strength. It now boasts more than 1 billion subscriptions across its range of services.\n",
            "True, this segment still makes up a relatively small part of the company's revenue, but it has been growing faster than the rest of its business for some time. And as its ecosystem continues to grow, Apple's product offerings and subscriptions will, too. That will add more fuel to the company's growth engine through 2030, and likely well beyond that.\n",
            "Apple's total returns -- including dividends reinvested -- have outpaced the broader market in the past five years.\n",
            "AAPL Total Return Level data by YCharts\n",
            "Apple's dividend program is most certainly one reason why Warren Buffett -- who famously loves dividends -- thinks so highly of the stock. Apple's forward yield of 0.44% isn't impressive. The average for the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) is 1.32%.\n",
            "However, the company's solid business, incredible ability to generate cash flow, and extremely conservative cash payout ratio of just 14% means Apple is a good dividend growth stock. That, combined with Apple's financial results, could lead to superior returns through 2030.\n",
